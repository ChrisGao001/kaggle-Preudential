The company said any decline would be due to expenses related to the acquisitions in the middle of the current quarter of seven licensees of Sealy Inc, as well as 82 pct of the outstanding capital stock of Sealy. Because of these acquisitions, it said, first quarter sales will be substantially higher than last year's 67.1 mln dlrs. Noting that it typically reports first quarter results in late march, said the report is likely to be issued in early April this year. It said the delay is due to administrative considerations, including conducting appraisals, in connection with the acquisitions."

chinese pork output seen lower -- usda,carcass livestock,"High feed prices will cause the Chinese to reduce hog herd growth and pork production this year, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. In its World Production and Trade Report, the department said hog numbers at the start of 1987 were estimated at 331.6 mln head, up slightly from 1986, and 10 mln head above earlier projections for 1987. Pork production in 1986 was up 4.2 pct to 17.25 mln tonnes, slightly below earlier estimates, it said. For 1987, production is projected to fall to 17.05 mln tonnes. Feed prices at the end of January were reported 35 to 40 pct above year-ago levels, the department said."
"swiss economy in excellent condition, oecd says",cpi gnp,"Switzerland's economy, combining low unemployment, financial stability and a large external payments surplus, is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory future, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, said. This reflected the success of stable and relatively tight fiscal and monetary policies followed by the government, it said. The OECD, in its annual report on Switzerland, picked out some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up in inflation this year, but said these gave no cause for concern. The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Product growth to 1.75 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986 and a small rise in consumer price inflation to 1.25 pct after last year's sharp fall to 0.75 pct from 3.6 pct in 1985. But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest increase in the workforce, leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at around one pct, the lowest in the 24-industrial nation OECD area. Assuming an average exchange rate of 1.71 Swiss francs to the dollar this year, against 1.69 in the second half of 1986, the report forecast a 2.75 pct rise in exports and a 3.5 pct rise in imports this year after rises of 3.25 pct and 6.5 pct respectively in 1986. The faster growth of imports compared with exports this year and last, reflecting buoyant private consumption, meant that the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDP would shrink in both years. But ""given Switzerland's large external surplus, there should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than GDP...Which, if only in a small way, would contribute to improving international balances,"" the OECD said. Real private consumption appeared to have been unusually buoyant last year, with a 3.25 pct growth rate, after several years of relative weakness, it noted. In 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat to a 2.25 pct growth rate, but should still outstrip overall GDP, it added. The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained bright into 1987, and with capacity use at near record levels last year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation in both the industry and service sectors, it said. As a consequence, growth in machinery and equipment investment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year after vigorous growth in 1986. But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for tourism and the banking industry, two major service sector earners of foreign exchange. The long-term appreciation of the Swiss Franc, and the accelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets, could lead to a loss of international market share for both, it said. Particularly for the banks, ""recent developments in international financial markets give rise to the question whether the Swiss financial system, which has shown substantial flexibility in the past, is adapting itself at the speed required ... To preserve its competitive position,"" it said."
u.s. wheat bonus to soviet called dormant,grain wheat,"The U.S. Agriculture Department is not actively considering offering subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union under the export enhancement program (EEP), senior USDA officials said. However, grain trade analysts said the proposal has not been ruled out and that an offer might be made, though not in the very near future. ""The grain companies are trying to get this fired up again,"" an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said. ""But there just isn't much talk about it, informally or formally."" Most analysts interviewed by Reuters were more confident than USDA officials that bonus wheat would be offered to the Soviets, even though U.S. officials did not make such an offer when they held grain talks with Soviet counterparts earlier this week. But administration and private sources agreed that if the Reagan administration did decide to offer subsidized wheat to Moscow, it could take several months. ""I just don't see any proposal like that sailing through any interagency process,"" the aide to Lyng said. ""An export enhancement offer is not consummated overnight,"" said one former USDA official, who noted that the administration took three months to decide in favor of selling China wheat under the subsidy program. An official representing a large grain trade company said deliberations within USDA might be nudged along by members of Congress, a number of whom urged USDA this week to make a wheat subsidy offer to the Soviets. But Lyng's aide said that during a day-long visit to Capitol Hill yesterday, House members did not press the secretary on the subsidy question a single time. The administration's interagency trade policy review group, comprised of subcabinet-level officials, has not been asked to clear a request to offer Moscow wheat under the EEP, officials at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said. In their talks this week, the two sides discussed the administration's previous EEP offer but did not talk about any new initiative. One USDA official who took part in the consultations this week described them as an exchange of ""calm, basic, factual economics."" Another USDA official said there was ""not even an informal suggestion or hint"" that the Soviets would live up to their pledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they were granted more favorable terms. USDA and private sources agreed that consideration of an EEP initiative by interagency review groups likely would be delayed because of disarray within the White House stemming from the Iran arms affair."
usda said unlikely to broaden corn bonus offer,grain corn,"The U.S. Agriculture Department probably will not offer a two dlr per bushel bonus payment to corn farmers for any erodible cropland they enrolled in the conservation reserve program last year, an aide to USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said. Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) said yesterday that Lyng had indicated he would consider giving those farmers the same two dlr bonus offered corn farmers who are signing up for the 1987 program this month. But the aide to Lyng said it was doubtful that the department would offer a retroactive bonus to farmers who enrolled land in the 10-year conservation reserve last year. ""How are you going to stop the tide,"" he said, referring to demands that would follow from other commodity groups."
relief to u.s. corn/oats growers said likely,grain corn oat,"U.S. farmers who in the past have grown oats for their own use but failed to certify to the government that they had done so probably will be allowed to continue planting that crop and be eligible for corn program benefits, an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said. Currently a farmer, to be eligible for corn program benefits, must restrict his plantings of other program crops to the acreage base for that crop. Several members of Congress from Iowa have complained that farmers who inadvertantly failed to certify that they had grown oats for their own use in the past now are being asked to halt oats production or lose corn program benefits. USDA likely will allow historic oats farmers to plant oats but not extend the exemption to all farmers, Lyng's aide said."
falling soybean crush ratios cut output,veg-oil oilseed meal-feed soybean soy-oil soy-meal,"The sharp decline in soybean crush ratios seen in the last few weeks, accelerating in recent days, has pushed margins below the cost of production at most soybean processing plants and prompted many to cut output of soybean meal and oil. The weekly U.S. soybean crush rate was reported by the National Soybean Processors Association this afternoon at 21.78 mln bushels, down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen over the past two months when crush margins surged to the best levels seen in over a year. Active soymeal export loadings at the Gulf had pushed soybean futures and premiums higher, prompting a pick-up in the weekly crush number. However, much of that export demand seems to have been met, with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surge in shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the next few months. U.S. processors are now finding domestic livestock feed demand is very light for this time of year due to the milder than normal winter, so they steadily dropped offering prices in an attempt to find buying interest, soyproduct dealers said. Soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recent weeks, setting a new contract low of 139.70 dlrs per ton in the nearby March contract today. ""Many speculators down here bought March soymeal and sold May, looking for no deliveries (on first notice day tomorrow, which would cause March to gain on deferreds),"" one CBT crush trader said. ""But they've been bailing out this week because the March has been acting like there will be a lot delivered, if not tomorrow, then later in the month,"" he added. As a result of the weakness in soymeal, the March crush ratio (The value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans) fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 22.6 cents per bushel today, dropping over five cents in just the last two days. The May crush ended today just over 17 cents, so no processors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitable level, the trader said. Hopefully, they will now start to cut back production to get supplies in line with demand, he added. With futures down, processors are finding they must bid premiums for cash soybeans, further reducing crush margins. A central Illinois processor is only making about 30 cents for every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices, down sharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and below the average cost of production, cash dealers said. Most soybean processing plants are still in operation, with little talk of taking temporary down-time, so far. But processors will start halting production in the next few weeks it they continue to face unprofitable margins, they added."
france faces pressue to change policies,cpi gnp,"France's right wing government is facing growing pressure to modify its economic policies after revising down its 1987 growth targets and revising up its inflation forecasts for this year. Moving reluctantly into line with most private sector forecasts the government yesterday raised its 1987 inflation estimate a half percentage point to 2.5 per cent and cut its economic growth estimate to between two and 2.8 per cent from a 2.8 per cent target written into the annual budget last september. Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the revised figures would not push the government off its chosen mix of price deregulation, budget-cutting rigour and pay restraint. But Trade Union leaders served immediate notice they would push to protect the purchasing power of their members, raising the spectre of a vicious spiral of wage and price rises. And bank economists contacted by Reuters said they believed Prime Minister Jacques Chirac could be forced by slow growth and rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year, perhaps in the autumn, to boost his prospects in Presidential elections due by April 1988. ""The outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago,"" said Societe Generale economist Alain Marais. ""We have the impression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth this year."" ""The big question is whether the government's policy of wage moderation will be maintained,"" he added. The government has set public sector wage rises at aboout 1.7 per cent this year, with a three per cent ceiling for rises justified by increased productivity. But the head of the socialist CFDT union federation, Edmond Maire, meeting with Chirac today, renewed union demands already rejected by the government for indexation clauses to be built into future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher prices. Calling the government's policies ""unbalanced and unjust,"" he also demanded investment incentives to boost employment. He announced after his meeting that Chirac had told him the government would spend two billion francs on a series of measures to boost employment and training Andre Bergeron, a widely respected leader of the moderate Force Ouvriere labour group, put similar demands to Chirac earlier in the week while the Communist-led CGT, the largest of France's unions, declared the defence of its members earnings its top priority. But with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month, and still rising, government supporters and some economic analysts said they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands. ""Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialist government and I dont think this administration is going to reverse that,"" commented Michel Develle, economist at recently-privatised Banque Paribas. Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmas and the New Year, partly blamed by the government for higher inflation, had undermined the unions power and popularity, he said. Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even more than the governments revised forecast, perhaps to 2.6 or 2.7 per cent this year against last years 2.1 per cent. ""But that would still be an exceptional achievement considering that for the first time since the Second World War all french prices have been freed,"" he commented. Finance Ministry officials said that the governments abolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible for nearly a quarter of a 0.9 per cent surge in January living costs. But they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that should have no knock-on impact on the rest of the year. Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that, so long as the government kept wages under control. Prices could rise 1.5 per cent in the first three months of 1987 and two per cent in the first half year, fractionally more than forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute, INSEE, Marais said. But the second half year should be better, he added. Ironically, one side effect of higher inflation could be to help the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget deficit, several analysts said. So long as public sector wages are held down, higher Value Added Tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset a loss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower than expected growth, they said."

australia's keating changes economic forecasts,gnp bop,"Domestic demand is now expected to make no contribution to Australian economic growth in fiscal 1986/87, ending June 30, while net exports will account for all of the overall increase, Treasurer Paul Keating said here. However, he did not say in his speech to the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) if the forecast 2.25 pct rise in gross domestic product (gdp) had been revised. But Keating said domestic demand could fall slightly this financial year and net export growth will provide the total source of gdp growth. The August budget had forecast domestic demand would contribute 0.75 percentage points to non-farm gdp growth of 2.5 pct while net exports would account for 1.75 points. Keating said the overall impact of the changed economic parameters is welcome as it appears to have contributed to a slightly more rapid correction in the current account deficit than first anticipated. ""The government initially forecast a current account deficit for 1986/87 of 14.75 billion -- our present expectation is that the result will be somewhat lower, around 14 billion,"" he said. Partial indicators released since the last meeting of EPAC in December indicate that the 1986/87 budget strategy is broadly on track, Keating said. ""They indicate that domestic demand has been a little more sluggish than was expected at budget time,"" he said. ""On the other hand, net exports seem to be expanding by more than expected at budget time, and this is underpinning growth in domestic production and employment."" Keating said it now seems likely that the 1986/87 inflation rate will exceed the budget forecast of eight pct. ""Nevertheless, there is likely to be a marked slowing in inflation over coming quarters as depreciation and budgetary effects wane,"" he said. Keating said the government expects economic growth to pick up moderately in 1987/88 due to a further significant rise in net exports and a very moderate but positive contribution from private domestic demand. He said domestic demand growth will be due to a strengthening in real household disposable income. The moderate rise in economic growth next financial year should be sufficient to sustain employment growth at a level broadly equivalent to that of the current fiscal year. ""The current account deficit will continue to show improvement in 1987/88,"" Keating said. ""As the impact of the exchange rate depreciations of recent years recede further, and given continued effective wage restraint, inflation should moderate markedly in 1987/88,"" he said."

indonesian agriculture growth expected to slow,grain wheat rice veg-oil soybean sugar rubber copra-cake corn palm-oil palmkernel coffee tea plywood soy-meal cotton,"Indonesia""s agriculture sector will grow by just 1.0 pct in calendar 1987, against an estimated 2.4 pct in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or declines, the U.S. Embassy said in a report. Production of Indonesia""s staple food, rice, is forecast to fall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of 26.58 mln tonnes in 1986, according to the annual report on Indonesia""s agricultural performance. The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at 26.7 mln tonnes, with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in 1987. The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because of a drawdown on stocks. ""Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the production of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or no gain,"" the report says. ""The modest overall increase which is expected will be due to significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oil and palm kernels."" Constraints to significant overall increases in agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant seeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance by farmers to shift from rice production to other crops, the report underlines. The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of pests known as ""wereng"" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which largely offset gains in yields. The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57 insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now resistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, more resistant rice types. The government is depending on increased production of export commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood and palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude oil prices. Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pct in 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports rising to an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, the report says. But while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (Oct-Sept) will rise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87, imports will also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant. The report says that imports of wheat, soybeans, soybean meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last September""s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise in domestic demand. The report said that Indonesia""s overall economic performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight negative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s.

The report said the 31 pct devaluation of the Indonesian rupiah, an increase in import duties on copra and increases in the price of Philippines copra have reduced the margin between prices in the two countries.

The 1986 projection of 1.45 mln tonnes is up from a provisional figure of 1.3 mln tonnes. A U.S. Embassy assessment puts 1987 output at 1.45 mln tonnes, against 1.35 mln in 1986 and 1.208 mln in 1985. ""More realistic estimates indicate that 1988 production will be between 1.5 and 1.6 mln tonnes,"" the report said. The report said the abolition of the five pct CPO export tax, the devaluation of the rupiah in September 1986 and higher international palm oil prices should lead to a modest increase in exports this year. Exports are forecast to rise to 720,000 tonnes against 695,000 tonnes in 1986, the report added."
"indonesian tea, cocoa exports seen up, coffee down",tea cocoa coffee,"Indonesia's exports of tea and cocoa will continue to rise in calendar 1987 but coffee exports are forecast to dip slightly in 1987/88 (April-March) as the government tries to improve quality, the U.S. Embassy said. The embassy's annual report on Indonesian agriculture forecast coffee output in 1986/87 would be 5.77 mln bags of 60 kilograms each. That is slightly less than the 5.8 mln bags produced in 1985/86. In 1987/88 coffee production is forecast to rise again to 5.8 mln bags, but exports to dip to 4.8 mln from around 5.0 mln in 1986/87. Exports in 1985/86 were 4.67 mln bags. The embassy report says coffee stocks will rise to 1.3 mln tonnes in 1987/88 from 1.15 mln in 1986/87. It bases this on a fall in exports as a result of the ""probable"" re-introduction of quotas by the International Coffee Organisation. Cocoa production and exports are forecast to rise steadily as the government develops cocoa plantations. Production of cocoa in Indonesia increased to 32,378 tonnes in calendar 1985 from 10,284 tonnes in 1980. It is projected by the government to rise to more than 50,000 tonnes by 1988. Production in 1986 is estimated by the embassy at 35,000 tonnes, as against 38,000 tonnes in 1987. The report forecasts cocoa exports to rise to 35,000 tonnes this year, from 33,000 tonnes in 1986 and 31,000 in 1985. The Netherlands is at present the biggest importer of Indonesian cocoa beans. The report forecasts that in calendar 1987, Indonesia's CTC (crushed, torn and curled) tea exports will increase significantly with the coming on stream of at least eight new CTC processing plants. Indonesia plans to diversify its tea products by producing more CTC tea, the main component of tea bags. Production of black and green teas is forecast in the embassy report to rise to 125,000 tonnes in calendar 1987 from 123,000 tonnes in 1986. Exports of these teas are likely to rise to 95,000 tonnes in 1987 from 85,000 in 1986 and around 90,000 in 1985. The embassy noted the ministry of trade tightened quality controls on tea in October 1986 in an effort to become more competititve in the world market."

"japan buys some 95,000 tonnes soybeans from china",oilseed soybean,"Japanese importers bought some 95,000 tonnes of Chinese soybeans late last month for May to September shipment, under the semi-annual trade accords, trade sources said. The FOB premium rose to 13.50 dlrs per tonne, up 2.50 dlrs from the premium for the November to April shipment, but down from 13.80 for the last May to September shipment. Flat prices for Chinese beans are based on futures prices in Chicago plus the FOB premium. Japanese purchases of Chinese soybeans, including spot buying, may have totalled 240,000 to 250,000 tonnes of the 1986 crop for November to April 1987 shipment, down from some 300,000 tonnes the previous year, the sources said. Domestic demand for edible-use soybeans is expected to remain stable at about 240,000 to 250,000 tonnes a year, the sources said. In recent years Japanese importers have overbought Chinese edible-use soybeans and sold the surplus to domestic crushers, but low 1986 U.S. Crop prices have discouraged the purchase of Chinese origin beans for crushing, they said."

It said Indonesia did not achieve its goal of self-sufficiency in soybean output in calendar 1986 because it did not meet a planned increase in area planted and because yields have remained below target. Soybean meal imports are forecast to fall to around 190,000 tonnes in 1987/88 from 270,000 tonnes in 1986/87 and 295,000 tonnes in 1985/86. Domestic soybean production is forecast to rise steadily to 1.08 mln tonnes in 1987/88 from 980,000 in the current year and 890,000 in 1985/86, the report said. Imports are forecast to fall in the current year but to rise in 1987/88 because of a new soybean crushing plant due to come on stream in early 1988. China is the main supplier with a 79 pct share, while the U.S. Provides the rest, it said. ""This pattern will likely continue during 1986/87 since domestic soyfood processors prefer Chinese beans and are willing to pay a premium for them,"" it said. Area planted is expected to increase by 10 pct in both 1986/87 and 1987/88. ""Yield increases continue to be hampered by an insufficient supply of quality seeds, along with pest and disease problems,"" the report said."

""We expect to shift our company toward higher value-added businesses and continue to broaden our base,"" Henderson told reporters at an informal meeting here. ICI today announced the formation of a new U.S. drug company, ICI Pharma, which, with its Stuart Pharmaceuticals unit, it said will double its current pharmaceutical sales to 1.1 billion dlrs by 1990. Henderson said, ""Our pharmaceutical business gets lost in the way that Glaxo's (Glaxo Holdings PLC) does not."" ICI's pharmaceutical division is the second largest drug maker behind Glaxo in the U.K. Last year U.S. drug sales were about 40 pct of its worldwide drug sales of 1.5 billion dlrs, which in turn brought in 27 pct of its total profits. He estimated that by 1990, ICI's pharmaceutical division would account for about 30 pct of total company profits. ""The drug division far and away brings in the highest rate of return,"" said A.W. Clements, finance director of ICI, who was also at the meeting. Henderson said the new U.S. drug concern would basically act as a second sales force to double the exposure of its drugs to doctors. ICI will hire 145 new salespeople by October one. Henderson said the major new products in the company's pipeline, expected to each bring in sales of over 200 mln dlrs annually, were Statil, a treatment for diabetic complications, Zoladex, a treatment for advanced prostate cancer, and Carwin, a treatment for mild to moderate congestive heart failure. Henderson said U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to market Statil and Zoladex, both under joint licensing agreements with Merck and Co Inc <MRK>, is not expected until about 1989. ICI expects to file for permission to market Carwin in the U.S. later this year. Henderson said the company's 1987 results would top 1986 income of 888 mln dlrs or 5.45 dlrs per ADR on sales of 15 billion dlrs, but he declined to specify by how much. Henderson said 1987's results would be boosted by Glidden Paints, which ICI bought last November for 580 mln dlrs from a unit of Hanson Industries Inc. Henderson also said that ICI has about nine billion dlrs available for acquisitions. Last year the company made 40 acquisitions, the largest being Glidden. He said that more acquisitions may be made this year but he ruled out an acquisition of a pharmaceutical concern as ""too expensive."" Henderson said that in his new role of chairman, effective April one when he takes over from Sir John Harvey-Jones who will retire, the biggest challenge ahead lay in continuing the earnings momentum ICI has established over the past few years after restructuring and selling off unprofitable businesses."
u.s. wheat groups call for global action,grain wheat,"All major grain producing countries must do their part to help reduce global surpluses and the recent Australian farm policy proposals are flawed, two U.S. wheat organizations said. The recent Australian proposals were a good starting point for discussions, ""but we do not want the Australians to feel they are alone in developing an agenda for discussions"" on world grain trade, the president of the National Association of Wheat Growers, NAWG, and the chairman of U.S. Wheat Associates said in a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter. Future discussions on international wheat trade should include three topics -- a commitment to privatization of government-run export trading entities, a commitment to public disclosure of sales and other terms if government entities are involved, and a recognition that supply reductions by the U.S. have kept world prices higher than they otherwise would be, the two organizations said While the Australian proposals are welcome the two organizations said they are not in total agreement with their assessments. Australia's proposals, which aim to reduce U.S. target prices and ""quarantine"" U.S. wheat stocks, would continue to place the burden of supply adjustment and reform on U.S. farmers, they said. Other countries, including Australia, have benefitted from the higher world prices that have resulted from past U.S. acreage and crop reduction programs, the organizations said. ""We will not continue to hurt ourselves economically -- and subsidize foreign wheat production -- by unilaterally stocking grain and changing programs which protect our growers,"" Jim Miller, president of NAWG said. ""We sincerely hope for some type of agreement among the world's major grain producing nations to reduce stocks and restore profitability to agriculture,"" Miller said."

yeutter blasts proposed ec oils and fats tax,veg-oil soy-oil oilseed soybean,"U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter today said that if the European Community's Council of Ministers approves a tax on vegetable oils and fats, another major transatlantic trade row will erupt over agriculture. In a statement issued by the trade representative's office following a speech to the American Soybean Association's board of directors, Yeutter said the proposed tax would have a severe impact on American soybean farmers, who export some 2.4 billion dlrs in soybeans and products annually to the EC. ""This is an unacceptable situation for us and its (vegetable oils tax) enactment would leave us no choice but to vigorously protect our trade rights and defend our access to the European market,"" Yeutter said. Yeutter said the proposed vegetable oils tax would violate EC obligations under the GATT. He said the effect of the tax would be to double the price of soyoil produced from imported soybeans, making margarine made from soyoil more expensive than tallow-based margarine, and closer in price to expensive European butter. ""I am astonished that the EC commission would propose such a provocative measure so soon after we successfully resolved the agricultural dispute over the enlargement of the EC to include Spain and Portugal,"" Yeutter said. ""It serves no purpose to embark on another confrontational course before the recent wounds have healed and as we are beginning to make progress on the Uruaguay round (of global trade talks),"" he said."
"france has little room for manoeuvre, oecd says",gnp trade,"French industry is failing to produce the goods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has left the government little room for manoeuvre to reflate the economy, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said. With gross domestic product likely to grow only 2.1 pct this year, the same rate as last year, unemployment could climb to 11.5 pct of the workforce by mid-1988, from its present 10.9 pct, it said in an annual review of the French economy. The report said the French economy was ""increasingly ill-adapted to demand"" selling goods at ""uncompetitive relative prices on both domestic and export markets."" ""France's poor export performance reflects a geographical bias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average... And...A substantial loss of market share...In the past 18 months,"" it said. Pointing to a likely widening of the French trade deficit to around 2.9 billion dlrs this year from 2.4 billion in 1986, it warned that a further depreciation of the dollar against the franc could lead to ""a (renewed) loss of competitiveness relative not only to the United States but also to the newly industrialised countries."" This could result in further major losses of market share, particularly in the non-OECD area, which accounts for almost a quarter of French exports, it said. Until the competitive ability of industry improved, the authorities would have ""little scope for macroeconomic manoeuvre, even if the unemployment situation or the need to encourage a pickup in investment could require demand to grow more briskly,"" it added. But rising unemployment could help to hold down wage demands, contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around a two pct annual rate this year and early next, the OECD said. Written mainly in December last year, the report took no account of a rise in oil prices early in 1987, and a 0.9 pct surge in January consumer prices, caused partly by the government's deregulation of service sector tariffs. ""We took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provoke runaway rises, and it is not absolutely certain that bet has been lost,"" one OECD official commented. OECD officials said the January data and a rise in oil prices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in the report, indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecast to around 2.5 or three pct. The government last week revised its forecast up to between 2.4 and 2.5 pct from two pct, against last year's 2.1 pct. But the OECD backed the government's view that the underlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year, with a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last year's fall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause of disinflation. With French unit productivity costs now among the lowest in the OECD area, the inflation differential between France and its main trading rival, West Germany, could fall to just one pct this year, it said. On the other hand, the report noted, consumer prices for industrial goods and private services have been rising steeply as companies built up their profits. ""For the disinflationary process to continue , and price competitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchange rate stability, it is essential that wage restraint continue,"" it said."
cbt february volume down 14 pct from year ago,grain oat corn oilseed soybean,"February volume at the Chicago Board of Trade, CBT, declined 14 pct from the year-ago month to 8,191,266 contracts, the exchange said. A relatively steady interest rate climate reduced volume in the most active contract, Treasury bond futures, by 17.5 pct from a year ago to 4,307,645 contracts. However, trading in most agricultural futures contracts increased last month, led by oats and corn futures. Oats volume tripled to 27,662 contracts, and corn volume increased 35 pct to 580,204 contracts. Wheat and soybean oil futures activity also rose from a year ago, while soybean and soybean oil volume slipped, the exchange said. Major Market Index futures increased activity 37 pct during the month with 194,697 contracts changing hands."
ussr wheat bonus rumors persist despite denials,grain wheat,"Grain trade representatives continued to speculate that the Reagan administration will offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union, while U.S. Agriculture Department officials said there was no substance to the reports. ""It's pure fiction,"" said one senior official at USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service, referring to the rumor that the administration would make an export enhancement offer to Moscow in the next two to three weeks. An aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng who asked not to be identified said there was nothing to substantiate the speculation, which he said was started by ""somebody fanning the (wheat) market."" Wheat futures strengthened today, partly on the basis of the speculation. One lobbyist with close connections to the Reagan administration said a Soviet trade team told private grain trade officials in New York last week that Moscow would buy as much as four mln tonnes of U.S. wheat, much of it before mid-year, if it was ""competitively priced."" Alexander Ivlev, an official with Amtorg, a Soviet trading organization, told Reuters he had no information to substantiate the rumors of an imminent wheat subsidy offer, but said that Moscow ""would consider"" buying U.S. wheat if it was competitively priced. ""We don't care if it is EEP, what we (the Soviets) are looking for is competitive prices,"" Ivlev said. ""If they (the administration) are interested in selling it (wheat), they should find ways to do it."""
japanese economist sees stable yen/dollar rates,money-fx yen dlr,"The yen should stabilize at around 152 to 153 to the U.S. Dollar for about a year, the Bank of Tokyo's economic adviser Koei Narusawa said. ""Both sides are showing clear interest to secure stability of the currencies. The major target of the Japanese government is to maintain the yen at above 150, at least for the rest of the year,"" he told reporters during a brief visit to Malaysia. Narusawa said the U.S. Is unlikely to push the yen up further because this might spark off inflation and depress the U.S. Economy before the 1988 presidential election. The yen is trading at around 153.70 to the dollar."
official inquiry set for australian wheat industry,grain wheat,"The government's industry aid and protection review body, the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC), will hold a 12-month inquiry into the Australian wheat industry, Primary Industry Minister John Kerin said. The IAC has been asked to report on the need for assistance to the industry and the nature, duration and extent of any aid, he said in a statement. He said the inquiry will be the first step in setting marketing arrangements to apply after June 30, 1989, when the underwriting and pricing provisions of the 1984 Wheat Marketing Act expire. Kerin said the broad-ranging reference would allow a full examination of all aspects of the wheat-marketing system. ""The inquiry will be required to take into account changes which have taken place in the industry as a result of the agricultural policies of major wheat producing countries and the industry's capacity to adjust to any recommended changes,"" he said. ""The inquiry is at an important time for the wheat industry, as the substantial fall in world prices is likely to trigger underwriting support from the government for the first time,"" he said. Kerin was referring to the government's underwriting of the guaranteed minimum price paid to wheatgrowers by the Australian Wheat Board near the start of the season. The IAC's report will be due at the same time as the findings of the current Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport, Kerin said. He said the timing of the IAC inquiry would allow its findings and those of the Royal Commission to be considered in later negotiations on wheat-marketing arrangements between the federal and state governments and the industry."

comalco says lower costs helped return to profits,earn alum,"Comalco Ltd <CMAC.S> said its return to profit reflected reduced costs, improved primary aluminium prices and its withdrawal from a Japanese smelter venture. It said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for the year ended December 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 was also aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt and greater sales of bauxite and aluminium. Comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents per share final, dividend delayed until July 1 to take advantage of proposed dividend imputation laws. This would make five cents for the year against a first and final of one cent in 1985. Comalco said the aluminium industry continued to suffer from low prices and excess capacity, though the weak Australian dollar had helped earnings. Withdrawal from the <Showa Aluminium Industries KK> joint venture had been recapitalised in expansion by the <New Zealand Aluminium Smelters Ltd> project with Japan's <Sumitomo Aluminium Smelting Co Ltd>, permitting repayments and increases in liquid funds totalling 165 mln dlrs, it said. As previously reported Comalco's <Commonwealth Aluminium Corp> unit has conditionally agreed to sell its smelter at Goldendale, Washington, and port facilities at Portland, Oregon to <Columbia Aluminium Corp>. Comalco said it had made a 27.3 mln dlr extraordinary provision for Goldendale losses and closure costs but that if the sales agreement were completed it would reduce the provision made in the 1986 accounts. The other items in the total extraordinary loss of 140.5 mln dlrs were a 102.9 mln write-off of unrealised exchange losses and 10.3 mln for an increase in future tax provision."
no bundesbank policy changes expected thursday,interest money-fx,"The Bundesbank is unlikely to change its credit policies at its central bank council meeting on Thursday, as exchange rates and short-term interest rates have stabilized over the past few weeks, money market dealers said. Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow's tender for a securities repurchase pact, from which funds will be credited on Thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining 16 billion marks from the system. The tender was announced last Friday, because carnival festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday, and will close banks here this afternoon. Because of the disruption to business from carnival, minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are unrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess their needs at the tender. Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough liquidity in this week's pact to keep short-term rates down. But because of uncertainty about banks' current holdings, the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks this week, and top it up if necessary at next week's tender. ""I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount a little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks,"" one dealer said. ""They would then stock it up at the next tender when the need is clearer,"" he added. An earlier pact expires next week, draining 8.5 billion marks from the system. Banks also face a heavy but temporary drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers.

"kenyan economy faces problems, president says",coffee crude,"The Kenyan economy is heading for difficult times after a boom last year, and the country must tighten its belt to prevent the balance of payments swinging too far into deficit, President Daniel Arap Moi said. In a speech at the state opening of parliament, Moi said high coffee prices and cheap oil in 1986 led to economic growth of five pct, compared with 4.1 pct in 1985. The same factors produced a two billion shilling balance of payments surplus and inflation fell to 5.6 pct from 10.7 pct in 1985, he added. ""But both these factors are no longer in our favour ... As a result, we cannot expect an increase in foreign exchange reserves during the year,"" he said. The price of coffee, Kenya's main source of foreign exchange, fell in London today to about 94 cents a pound from a peak of 2.14 dlrs in January 1986. Crude oil, which early last year slipped below 10 dlrs a barrel, has since crept back to over 18 dlrs. Moi said the price changes, coupled with a general decline in the flow of capital from the rest of the world, made it more difficult to finance the government's budget deficit. Kenya was already spending over 27 pct of its budget on servicing its debts and last year it was a net exporter of capital for the first time in its history, he added. ""This is a clear indication that we are entering a difficult phase as regards our external debts, and it is imperative that we raise the rate of domestic savings and rely less on foreign sources to finance our development,"" he said. ""It will be necessary to maintain strict discipline on expenditure ... And members of this house will have to take the lead in encouraging wananchi (ordinary people) to be more frugal in satisfying immediate needs,"" the president added."

Snow cover is scant in Poland, with only about 50 pct of the winter wheat areas reporting one to two inches of snow as of this morning. The remaining 50 pct of winter wheat crops do not have snow cover, making winterkill possible on each of the next two nights. Lowest temperatures will be minus 10 to 0 degrees F. Winter wheat areas from eastern Czechoslovakia through northern Romania had light snow flurries yesterday and last night, but amounts were an inch or less.

The report, dated February 26, said there is evidence of delayed germination in most areas due to late seeding last fall because of dry conditions. However warm temperatures over the past three weeks have promoted some early growth and will help the crop catch up on last fall's late seeding, it said. Some Yugoslav agriculture officials are concerned about the situation because warm temperatures have brought the grain out of dormancy and taken away snow protection a little early, the report said. Cold temperatures over the next month could cause damage under these conditions, they said. The report said all wheat farmers contacted during the field trip were optimistic about the crop and the way it emerged from winter."
belgian minister sees new accord on ec oils/fats,veg-oil livestock carcass,"Belgian Foreign Trade Minister Herman De Croo said he believed there would be a compromise within the European Community, EC, on its proposed tax on vegetable fats and oil, averting a pledged tough trade response by the United States. De Croo, in Washington for talks with Administration officials and Congressional leaders, said at a news conference there is a battle within the community on the tax on fats and oils used in the 12 EC countries. But he added, ""I do not think it will be a big issue because there will be a big debate inside Europe,"" adding ""so there will be a compromise."" U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said yesterday that if the community went ahead with the tax, the United States would respond ""vigorously"" to protect its trade rights and access to community markets. De Croo also said he thought the community would postpone its April 28 deadline for imposing new slaughterhouse rules to cover all meats brought into EC nations if some progress was made toward resolving differences with the United States. U.S. officials say its rules now meet health standards and the EC should require equivalent but not identical standards. He also told reporters he hoped the community could deal with another controversial health proposal that would forbid the feeding of hormones to cattle, which is also opposed by the United States. De Croo gave no deals on how he though the issue might be resolved. That rule is go into effect on January 1, 1988. He said U.S. cattlemen say there is no reason to change slaughterhouse practices in April if the meat is to be banned a few months later by the hormone rule."

The decision to make the payments in a 50/50 cash/certs ratio was made Monday, but payments to producers will be delayed until mid-month due to a problem with USDA's computer program, von Garlem said. get 11.5 cts per bushel in this next payment -- 5.75 cts in certs and around 5.5 cts cash (5.75 cts minus Gramm-Rudman). Farmers who did not receive advance deficiency payments at signup will receive 63 cts per bushel. Slightly more than half of this payment will be in cash, von Garlem said, but he said this will not markedly upset the 50/50 ratio, since most farmers got advance payments. ""The final certificate payments will be very close to 300 mln dlrs,"" he said. When asked if the Office of Management and Budget had resisted the cash/certs ratio, the USDA official said that ""we proposed 50/50 and OMB accepted it."""

soviet soymeal imports seen rising in 1987,meal-feed soy-meal grain corn,"Soviet imports of soymeal may reach or exceed one mln tonnes between January and September this year, the Oil World newsletter said. Oil World said it was likely the Soviet Union would reduce soybean imports and step up significantly its imports of meal. At least 500,000 tonnes of soymeal may be shipped from the European Community and South America in the January/March quarter, with additional large quantities likely to be imported in the April and July quarters from Argentina and Brazil, it said. No figures were given for imports in the corresponding periods of 1986. The change made sense in view of the recent purchases of probably 250,000 tonnes of West European and Polish rapeseed and large scale butter imports that were expected from March onward, it said. Oil World said substantial losses of Soviet winter grain area due to recent severe frosts were probably behind the recent pick-up in Soviet purchases of U.S. Corn. It noted that an additional one mln tonnes of U.S. Corn had been bought recently by the Soviet Union."
french exporters see higher wheat sales to china,grain wheat ship,"French exporters estimated that around 600,000 tonnes of French soft wheat has been sold to China for delivery in the 1986/87 (July/June) year. Around 300,000 tonnes were exported to China between July 1986 and February this year. Another 100,000 to 150,000 tonnes will be shipped during this month and around the same amount in April, they said. France sold around 250,000 tonnes of soft wheat to China in 1985/86, according to customs figures. However, certain exporters fear China may renounce part of its contract with France after being offered one mln tonnes of U.S. soft wheat under the Export Enhancement Program in January and making some purchases under the initiative."

more intermediate u.s. wheat credits for morocco,grain wheat,"The Commodity Credit Corporation has approved an additional 45.0 mln dlrs under its interemdiate export credit guarantee program, GSM-103, for sales of U.S. wheat to Morocco, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. The action increases Morocco's cumulative fiscal year 1987 program for wheat under GSM-103 to 75.0 mln dlrs. The credit terms extended for exports under the program must be in excess of three years but no more than seven years to eligible for credit coverage. All sales under this line must be registered and exported by September 30, 1987. The department also said the guarantee line for sales of U.S. wheat under the Export Credit Guarantee Program, GSM-102, has been decreased 45.0 mln dlrs to 60.0 mln."
"u.s. corn, sorghum payments 50-50 cash/certs",grain corn sorghum,"Eligible producers of 1986 crop U.S. corn and sorghum will receive an estimated 600 mln dlrs in deficiency payments -- 50 pct in generic commodity certificates and 50 pct in cash, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. It said corn producers will receive about 515 mln dlrs and sorghum producers about 85 mln dlrs. Only the cash portion of the payments will be subject to the 4.3 pct reduction in compliance with the Gramm-Rudman budget deficit control act of 1985, it said. Corn and sorghum producers who requested advance deficiency payments have already received about 2.8 billion dlrs and 225 mln dlrs, respectively, USDA said. The Department said deficiency payment rates of 51.5 cents per bushel for corn and 49 cents per bushel for sorghum were received by producers requesting advance payments. Deficiency payments are calculated as the difference between an established target price and the higher of the basic loan rate, or the national average price received by farmers during the first five months of the marketing year -- September-January. National weighted average market prices for the first five months of the season were 1.46 dlrs per bushel for corn and 1.33 dlrs per bushel for sorghum. Eligible corn producers will be paid 63 cts per bushel, based on the difference between the 3.03 target price and the 2.40 dlr per bushel basic loan rate. Sorghum producers' deficiency payment rate will be 60 cents per bushel, based on the difference between the 2.88 dlrs per bushel target price and the 2.28 dlrs per bushel basic loan rate. The deficiency payment rates for both commodities are the maximum permitted by law, the department said. Eligible corn and sorghum producers will receive another 1986 crop deficiency payment in October if the national average market prices received by farmers during the entire marketing year for both commodities are below the basic loan rates, the department said. The payments will be issued through local Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service offices, it said."

The department said the proposed change is in response to a petition from Public Voice for Food and Health Policy and would present a more positive image of this grade of beef and help calorie-conscious consumers select leaner cuts of meat. Under current rules, the ""good"" grade of meat has less marbling and fat than the ""prime"" or ""choice"" grades, it said. Standards for all of the grades would remain unchanged under the proposal."
australian government to pay subsidies--usda,grain wheat,"The Australian Government will likely reimburse the Australian Wheat Board, AWB, about 132 mln (U.S.) dlrs to pay wheat farmers for their 1986/87 crop, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the department said the sharp fall in world wheat prices has reduced the export sales revenue of the AWB to levels insufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated at around 98 dlrs per tonne. For example the recent large sales of wheat to China (1.5 mln tonnes) and Egypt (2.0 mln tonnes) were well below the breakeven export price, it said. Australian wheat farmers normally receive an advance payment known as the Guaranteed Minimum Price, GMP, calculated at 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the current year and the two lowest of the previous three years, the department said. In addition, deductions for taxes, freight, handling and storage are deducted from the GMP the farmer receives. But the department said the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Economics, BAE, predicts wheat production will drop sharply from 17.8 mln tonnes in 1986/87 to 13.5 mln in 1989/90. The decline will result from low world grain prices leading to shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit U.S. wheat exports, the department said."
japan cutting china corn commitments - usda,wheat corn,"Japanese traders have apparently sharply reduced commitments to buy Chinese corn over the next six months due to high prices, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. In its World Production and Trade Report, the department said traders indicated China may lack supplies or be unwilling to sell at current low world prices. If the reports are confirmed, China's major export destinations such as USSR, Japan, and South Korea, could increase purchases of U.S. corn, it said. China is currently forecast to export 5.5 mln tonnes of corn during 1986/87 (Oct-Sept), it said."
ec driving to capture brazil wheat market - usda,grain wheat,"The European Community, EC, sold 75,000 tonnes of soft wheat at a subsidized price of between 85 and 89 dlrs per tonne FOB for March delivery in a continuing bid to establish itself in the Brazilian wheat market, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. The sale sharply undercut the U.S. offer of 112 dlrs per tonne FOB for 33,000 tonnes of wheat, it said in its latest report on Export Markets for U.S grains. EC sales to Brazil total about 225,000 tonnes during 1986/87 (July-June) in stark contrast to only 50,000 tonnes in the 1985/86 season, it said. The increasing presence of EC wheat in Brazil comes at a time when the Brazilian Wheat Board, BWB, expects the wheat import market will expand to 3.4 mln tonnes from the current forecast of 3.0 mln in the 1986/87 year. The BWB cites record consumption and an eventual decline in domestic production, and says government plans to lower the guaranteed price of wheat from 242 dlrs per tonne to 180 dlrs will contribute to greater import demand, the USDA said. It said the BWB expects the U.S. to be major supplier of the additional 400,000 tonnes, but commitments for purchase of U.S. wheat through two-thirds of 1986/87 year total only 600,000 tonnes versus 700,000 a year ago."

""We believe that this indicates good producer support for the new checkoff. We're getting good compliance from markets, from packers and from dealers,"" Rosendale said."
south africa corn exports could be reduced-usda,grain corn,"Despite earlier optimistic indications, the South African corn crop is at a critical stage in its development and recent reports of heat stress could reduce production and therefore exportable supplies, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the department said South Africa's corn exports in the 1986/87 (Oct-Sept) season are estimated at 2.5 mln tonnes, up 40 pct from the previous year. The re-emergence of South Africa as a competitor follows a period of severe droughts, which at one point required South Africa to import 2.7 mln tones of U.S. corn in 1983/84, it said. Since those imports in 1983/84, the U.S. has been facing increased competition from South Africa in Taiwan and Japan. But if South Africa is perceived as lacking available supplies, purchases of U.S. corn may be further stimulated, the department said."
cbt traders look ahead to spring plantings,grain cotton wheat oat oilseed soybean,"Chicago Board of trade grain traders and analysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned to handle their upcoming spring plantings, prompting sales of new crop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeans in the futures markets. Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers will be more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans because corn is protected by the acreage reduction program. That gives deficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low. Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they sign-up for reduced acreage, but they have no price guarantees. With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal, traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thing rather than gamble on soybeans, even though the new crop soybean/corn ratio of 2.9/1 would make planting soybeans more attractive under normal circumstances. An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift the limited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop, means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mln more oat acres this year than last without being penalized, traders said. Here too, acres some farmers may have been thinking of shifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats, due to the more attractive deal from the government, they added. Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six months ago, which should prompt many farmers in the South to put soybean land back into cotton. One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybean production in recent years has been a general shift of acres in traditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans, which are easier to grow, one commercial trader said."
swap dealers unveil standard contract,money-fx interest,"The International Swap Dealers Association has developed the first standard form contract for use by arrangers of currency and interest rate swap transactions, said Thomas Jasper, the Association's co-chairman. The contract, unveiled at a press conference , is expected to make the 300 billion dlr a year swap market more efficient, he said. ""The contracts wil accelerate the process and reduce the expense of swap documentation,"" Japsper said. Privately, eurobond traders estimate that about 80 pct of all new issues eventually become part of either an interest rate or currency swap. An interest rate swap occurs when two issuers, usually acting through a bank middleman, agree to accept each other's interest payments on debt securities. Usually, the issuer of a floating rate debt security swaps into fixed-rate debt and vice versa. But the obligation for repayment of the debt remains with the original borrower. Bank regulators have become concerned about the use of swaps because the middleman, usually a bank, takes on some portion of the risk but is not required to show it on the balance sheet as a liability and may not have sufficient capital to cushion it. Kenneth McCormick, a co-chairman of the ISDA and president of Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc, said the Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board were expected later today to announce joint proposals for setting minimum capital standards for counterparties in swaps. The standards are part of the recently announced convergence agreement between the two countries in which regulators have attempted to set similar capital requirements for institutions. McCormick told reporters the ISDA was concerned that a ""level playing field"" be maintained in the swaps market. He said if U.K. And U.S. Banks were required to hold more primary capital against swap transactions than is the current practice, the additional costs would have to be passed on to issuers. The issuers might then choose to do business with lower-cost banks which are not subject to U.S. Or U.K. Banking rules. He said the ISDA had been working on a code of conduct for swap dealers as part of its self-regulatory effort. That code should be completed within the next few weeks, he said."

u.s. treasury aide warns on inflation,money-fx dlr,"Thomas Berger, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, said that a further drop in the exchange value of the dollar could cause prices to go up and trigger inflation. He told a meeting of the President's Export Council that the Japanese and the Germans have cut their profit margins to reflect recent drops in the dollar, so prices have remained much the same. But he added that if the dollar dropped further there could be inflation in the United States. Berger also said that a further devalued dollar may cause economic depressions in some U.S. trading partners, and that would not be in America's interest because it would close those markets to U.S. goods."
"fed drafts currency, rate swap risk gauge",interest money-fx,"The Federal Reserve Board voted unanimously to propose a formula for calculating the risk of interest rate and currency swaps as part of its ongoing effort to come up with a new capital standard for U.S. banks that takes into account the riskiness of a bank's loans and other assets. Fed officials said an identical proposal was being issues today by the Bank of England. The Fed set a 60-day period for public comment on the plan. The proposal adopted today addresses only the credit risks associated with interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and similar financial instruments. Previously, the Fed Jan. 8 proposed a series of guidelines for calculating the risk of other off-balance-sheet activities that banks would be required to take into account in calculating the minimum financial cushion they would need to maintain. Both guidelines set five broad categories of risk for loans and other bank assets and assigned to each a level of risk that would establish a bank's minimum capital needs. The additional guidelines proposed today would determine the amount of capital support required for a bank's current exposure for a given asset and the potential future exposure. The current exposure would be measured by the mark-to-market value of the asset, which would reflect the replacement cost. Potential future increases in the replacement cost would be calculated using credit conversion factors based on statistical analyses by the staffs of the Bank of England and U.S. banking regulators. Future exposure would rise over the life of the asset. The Fed staff said the risk gauge attempted to balance conflicting needs for precision and simplicity. They ignore, for example, the relative volatility of the particular currencies involved in exchange rate contracts. Board officials said the new gauge could increase the capital required of the largest money center banks, which are the principal participants in these types of activities. They cautioned the Fed board to take account of the potential impact of the plan on the ability of U.S. banks to compete in world financial markets. However, the staff concluded, ""The credit risks inherent in such contracts now constitute a significant element of the risk profiles of some banking organizations."" The Fed proposal would exempt all but the 20-25 largest participants in this market, on grounds the benefits of including the smaller banks would be outweighed by costs. Also excluded would be interest rate and foreign exchange contracts traded on organized exchanges. Governor Martha Seger said she was concerned that Japan was not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new capital rules."
january crude oil movements fall seven mln tons,crude ship,"Worldwide spot crude oil movements fell to 30.07 mln long dwt in February from 37.25 mln tons in January and 41.44 mln in December, London shipbroker Howard Houlder said. The decline mainly reflected a sharp drop in movements out of the Mideast Gulf, which totalled 7.4 mln tons last month against 11.65 mln in January. These included shipments to western options at 2.05 mln tons against 3.59 mln previously. Liftings from the Gulf to eastern options fell to 4.15 mln tons from 5.94 mln and those from the Gulf to other areas dropped to 1.2 mln tons from 2.13 mln, Howard Houlder said. U.K./Continent coastal movements declined sharply to 2.91 mln tons from 4.77 mln but those from the U.K./Continent to the U.S. rose to 1.99 mln from 1.69 mln."
ec sources detail new farm social package,livestock carcass grain,"The 350 mln Ecu three-year package of social and structural measures agreed early today by European Community farm ministers features a plan to compensate farmers for reducing output of certain surplus products, EC Commission sources said. The ministers agreed that under this ""extensification"" scheme, farmers would qualify for compensation if they cut output of specific products by at least 20 pct. The plan would initially apply to cereals, beef, veal and wine, they added. Cereals farmers would have to achieve their output cuts by reducing acreage, while cattle farmers would reduce their number of head and vinegrowers would cut yield. In each case, farmers would have to undertake not to step up their capacity for output of other products which are in surplus in the EC. The sources said payment levels have not yet been fixed but will be designed to compensate farmers for loss of profit on the production they forego. The sources said the package also contains provisions for payments to farmers who embark on a program aimed at protecting or improving the environment. It would also mean compensatory allowances in less favoured farming areas would be extended to crops. At present such allowances are available only for livestock. The package would provide 20 mln Ecus for research into alternative farming techniques, the sources added. At a news conference EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen said the Commission is also working on proposals to enable the EC and member states to provide direct income supports for relatively poor farmers. Andriessen did not give full details, but said member state aid would be subject to ""strict criteria to avoid distortion of competition."" EC payments would aim to help farmers to survive a difficult period while the EC tackles the problems of surplus production. The Commission withdrew from the package agreed last night proposals to pay ""early retirement"" pensions to farmers aged 55 or over who gave up production. Those who took their land completely out of farm production, rather than passing it on to their heirs, would have received more generous payments. Andriessen said the Commission plans to present revised proposals along these lines in an effort to get a scheme agreed."
"u.s., britain agree further bank capital proposals",money-fx interest,"The Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board have agreed new proposals for joint standards to measure the risk of an array of credit exposures that do not show up in bank balance sheets, the Bank of England said. The plan, covering swaps, forward contracts and options involving interest or exchange rates, complements proposals agreed in January between the two central banks to make commercial banks in the U.S. And Britain subject to similar standards for measuring capital adequacy, the proposal said. It said no final decisions had been reached yet and banks have until April 16 to comment on the trunk proposals. The Bank of England and Fed said they had faced a dilemma. ""On the one hand (we) are determined to require adequate capital support for potential future exposure -- on the other hand (we) are concerned that overly stringent capital requirements might unnecessarily affect the ability of U.S. And U.K. Banking organisations to price...Contracts competitively."" At the basis of the new proposals lies the concept of the so-called credit equivalent amount - the current value of a currency or interest rate contract and an estimate of its potential change in value due to currency or interest rate fluctuations until the contract matures. In treatment similar to that agreed in January for balance sheet assets, the credit equivalent will be assigned one of five risk weights between zero and 100 pct, depending on the quality of the counterparty, the remaining maturity of the contract and on collaterals or guarantees to the contract, the plans showed. The proposal showed that collaterals and guarantees would not be recognised in calculating credit equivalent amounts. They would, however, be reflected in the assignment of risk weights. The only guarantees recognised are those given by U.S. And U.K. Governments or, in the U.S., By domestic national government agencies, the proposals showed. The paper said the proposed rules would not cover spot foreign exchange contracts and securities traded in futures and options exchanges. It said U.S. Regulatory authorities and the Bank of England were keen to encourage banks to ""net"" contracts -- consolidate multiple contracts with the same counterparty into one single agreement to create one single payments stream. It recognised that ""such arrangements may in certain circumstances reduce credit risk and wish to encourage their further development and implementation,"" and said some of the current proposals may be changed to take this into account.

frost not expected to damage poland's wheat,grain wheat,"Poland's winter wheat is likely to survive recent frosts but the impact of the cold will not be known until late April, the Polish meteorology institute said. Some varieties of winter wheat sown in Poland can survive ground temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees C, Spokesman Teresa Tomaszewska told Reuters. Even though an earlier thin protective layer of snow mainly melted in February, air temperatures down to minus 30 C should not be harmful, she said, but added that wheat can still be damaged by cold spells in March and April, when young shoots may be exposed to night frosts."
torrential rains halt argentine grain harvest,grain corn sorghum oilseed sunseed soybean,"Torrential rains throughout Argentina's grain-producing areas virtually paralysed coarse grain harvesting in the week to yesterday, trade sources said. Sunflower, maize and sorghum harvests were particularly affected, they said. But the rains proved to be a great aid to soybean crops as their harvesting will not begin until April or May. The rains did no damage to maize, sunflower and sorghum crops though fresh rains in similar volume could reduce yields and cut the total volume of this year's harvest. Rainfall measured between 15 and 270 mm in Buenos Aires, with the heaviest rains in the province's western sectors, between 15 and 100 mm in Cordoba, 15 and 120 mm in La Pampa, 10 and 75 mm in Santa Fe, 10 and 60 mm in Entre Rios, five and 40 mm in Misiones, and five and 50 mm in San Luis. No rain was recorded in Corrientes, Chaco and Formosa. Growers did not revise their estimates for total volume of the coarse grain harvest over last week's estimates. Maize harvesting continued moving forward in central Santa Fe, though slowly. Growers had harvested seven to nine pct of total planted area, compared to five to seven pct last week. Total maize area planted for the 1986/87 harvest was estimated at between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares, or two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest. Maize production is expected to total between 10.4 and 11 mln tonnes, or a drop of 17.5 to 19.4 pct over the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes harvested last year according to private estimates, or 18.9 to 21.9 pct lower than last year's volume, according to official figures. The sunflower harvest advanced to between seven and nine pct of total planted area. Two to 2.2 mln hectares have been planted with sunflowers for this harvest, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct from last year's figure of 3.14 mln hectares. Sunflower production is expected to total between 2.4 mln and 2.7 mln tonnes, which would mean a drop of between 34.1 and 41.5 pct against the record 4.1 mln tonnes harvested in the 1985/86 harvest. Grain sorghum harvesting inched forward to between two and four pct of total planted area, which this harvest is 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares or 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest. Sorghum production is expected to total between 3.2 mln and 3.5 mln tonnes, or 16.7 to 22 pct less than the 4.1 to 4.2 million tonnes harvested in 1985/86. Soybean production, by contrast, is expected to hit a record 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes, which would mean an increase of 11.1 to 15.1 pct over last year's record figure of 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes, according to private estimates. Official figures put last year's soybean harvest at 7.1 mln tonnes. Soybean crops were reported to be in generally very good condition, helped by abundant rains and high temperatures. Total soybean-planted area for the 1986/87 harvest is expected to be a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares, up 10.8 to 13.8 pct from last year's harvest figure of 3.34 mln hectares."
u.s. senator to propose 0/92 for 1987 crops,grain wheat cotton rice,"Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., said he intended to offer legislation that would allow 1987 producers of wheat, feedgrains, cotton and rice to receive at least 92 pct of their deficiency payments, regardless of how much they planted. Boschwitz told the Senate Agriculture Committee that applying the so-called 0/92 provision to 1987 crops was supported by the Reagan administration and would save approximately 500 mln dlrs, including 266 mln dlrs in corn payments, 90 mln dlrs in wheat and 30 mln dlrs in cotton. The Minnesota senator said he might offer the bill on the Senate floor or in a conference committee with the House of Representatives in the event a similar bill before the House Agriculture Committee is approved by that body. Boschwitz told Reuters that neither he nor the U.S. Agriculture Department had decided whether or how deficiency payments should be guaranteed to farmers who might choose not to plant under the decoupling scheme. If payments are not set in advance under decoupling, market prices conceivably could rise, thereby leading to diminished deficiency payments. Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said he wanted to go to conference with the House as soon as possible on the issue, but would have to study the matter further before deciding how he would vote on it."

turkey sees 1.5 billion dlr deficit in 1986,bop trade gnp,"Turkey expects a 1986 balance of payments deficit of 1.5 billion dlrs, well over target, but is taking steps to improve its performance in this and other fields, Ali Tigrel, director of economic planning at the State Planning Organisation said. He told Reuters the shortfall was a direct consequence of economic growth of nearly eight pct, up from 5.1 pct in 1985, which he said resulted mostly from a surge in domestic demand. Tigrel acknowledged a need to cut inflation further after a drop of more than 12 points to 24.6 pct in the Treasury wholesale index last year. This year's target of 20 pct ""might be attainable but the economic management will have to be careful,"" he said. Tigrel, whose department produces the annual programme which is central to the government's economic planning, said Turkey's creditworthiness was at risk over the current account shortfall, originally targeted at 695 mln dlrs. ""We must alleviate the current account substantially to sustain the creditworthiness that we have managed to secure over the last five years,"" he added. His comment echoed last October's Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development report on Turkey, which said Ankara's case for more medium-term financing on better terms would look better if inflation were lower and the current account deficit cut or turned into a surplus. ""In 1987 we must reduce the rate of growth in public sector investments, we must reduce the public sector deficit as a percentage of GNP and we must achieve a very visible improvement in the current account deficit,"" he said. Tigrel said a surge in public sector spending last year was also to blame for the high deficits. Appropriations to government departments had been cut by eight pct since the budget was passed in December and foreign borrowing by municipalities had been restrained. ""We are trying make sure that public bodies stick to the investment programme and do not exceed their appropriations,"" he said. It was hoped to bring the public sector borrowing requirement down to five pct of GNP in 1987 from an estimated 5.6 pct in 1986. More modest GNP growth of five pct for 1987 was also targeted, Tigrel said. Measures were being taken to encourage exports, and production incentives were being considered. ""We must try to make sure that more capacity is injected into the Turkish economy in the coming years. The promotion policy is geared to make sure that both foreign investment and local private capital come more into play as far as manufacturing capacity is concerned,"" Tigrel said. He said the process of structural adjustment of the Turkish economy to free market policies, begun in 1980, was still under way. Trade had been liberalised and a freer exchange rate policy applied, but he acknowledged there was more to be done in a country where the state still dominates industry and the currency is only partially convertible."
french wheat exports to ec fall,grain wheat,"French soft wheat exports to other European Community countries fell 18 pct to 4.13 mln tonnes in the first seven months of the 1986/87 season to January compared with 5.04 mln in the same 1985/86 period, the French Cereals Intervention Office (ONIC) said. According to latest ONIC statistics, the main buyers were Italy with 1.89 mln against 1.63 mln in the same 1985/86 period, West Germany 480,450 tonnes against 717,689, the Netherlands 462,048 (532,299) and Belgium 417,887 tonnes (919,337). British and Greek imports of French soft wheat during this period were below year-ago levels. Between July 1 last year and January 31, Britain bought 274,665 tonnes against 642,800 tonnes, ONIC figures showed. But Spanish purchases were up sharply at 258,507 tonnes against 2,751 tonnes in the same 1985/86 period and Portugal bought 37,599 tonnes compared with zero. ONIC said the drop in French exports to other Community countries was due to British competition."
estimated french barley stocks worrying - onic,grain barley corn,"The size of French 1986/87 carryover barley stocks, estimated at 1.72 mln tonnes compared with 700,000 tonnes in 1985/86 is worrying, French Cereals Intervention Office (ONIC) Director Bernard Vieux said. He told journalists these estimates were unchanged at the end of February from the previous month while export forecasts were lowered to 4.5 mln tonnes from 5.76 mln in 1985/86. Vieux called on the EC Commission to help by awarding a larger volume of export certificates and said if no outlets are opened for French barley a large amount could be put into intervention. A small amount of French barley has already been put into intervention, Vieux said without detailing the amount. The outlook for French maize is better with 1986/87 exports to non-EC countries now put at 700,000 tonnes against 200,000 tonnes at the end of January and against 155,000 tonnes in 1985/86. The higher estimate is due to the EC Commission's decision to hold special export tenders for French maize, he said."

canada wheat board advises cut in grain prices,grain wheat,"The Canadian Wheat Board has advised the federal government to sharply cut initial prices paid to farmers for their wheat, oats, and barley in the crop year beginning August 1, a board spokesman said. The spokesman declined to give the size of the recommended price drops but said it would not be good news for western Canadian grain growers. ""They're all lower,"" he said. ""This is really getting pretty serious. We're talking nuts and bolts economic survival and whether it's worthwhile for farmers to put in a crop."" Farm leaders and economists have estimated the board will recommend cuts of around 20 pct in the initial prices. Farmers receive the initial payment when the grain is delivered to the elevators used by the wheat board. If the wheat board, which markets most of Canada's grain, obtains higher than expected prices on world markets, the farmers receive a final payment at the end of the crop year. If prices are lower, the federal treasury makes up the difference. The final decision on the initial prices, usually made in April, rests with Wheat Board Minister Charles Mayer and the federal cabinet. Last year Mayer cut the initial prices between 19 and 27 pct but last fall the government announced a one billion Canadian dlr aid program to compensate for the price cuts. But federal agricultural officials have already warned farmers not to depend on additional government aid this year."

"new bank rules tougher than needed, dealers say",interest money-fx,"U.S. and U.K. bank regulators are asking banks to set aside more reserves than is necessary to cushion them against the risks posed by the interest rate and currency swap transactions they carry, swap dealers said. After viewing proposed guidelines released jointly today by the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Board, dealers said that in effect, regulators are asking them to set aside reserves twice for the same risk. Market participants will have 60 days to respond to the proposals. Adoption of stiffer capital requirements is especially significant in the eurobond markets, which saw new issue volume of about 183 billion dlrs in 1986 according to figures compiled by Euromoney magazine. While no firm figures exist, dealers in eurobonds estimate that 80 pct of all new issues are involved in some swap arrangement. Separately, the ISDA estimates that about 300 billion dlrs worth of swap transactions are outstanding. Kenneth McCormick, co-chairman of the International Swap Dealers Association (ISDA) and President of Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc, said that the Association has no comment and will study the proposals. ""What they are proposing is really double counting,"" Patrick de Saint-Aignan, managing director of swaps for Morgan Stanley and Co, said. Instead, he argues, banks should either be required to hold a percentage of the face value -- say one pct per year to maturity -- or to hold a percentage of the cost of replacing the contract in the event of a counterparty default. ""The potential risk factors are very large relative to what we had expected,"" said a director at one U.K. merchant bank. ""What they are really doing is asking you to capitalize now -- to borrow money now -- to cushion you against risk you might have 10 years from now,"" he added.(Adds title first paragraph). Dealers also said they believe that banks not covered by the agreement, such as those based in Japan, will have a competitive advantage because they will not have to pass the costs on to customers. Indeed, regulators are apparently also concerned about the exclusion of other countries from the new requirements. Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger, following approval of the proposed guidelines by the Fed, said she is concerned that Japan was not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new capital rules. Dealers said they were somewhat relieved to see that bank regulators recognized the concept of netting, that is, offsetting the amounts receiveable from and payable to a single counterparty against each other. The paper said that regulatory authorities ""recognize that such arrangements (netting) may in certain circumstances reduce credit risk."" Furthermore, the paper said, if a netting agreement could be reached that would withstand legal tests, it might be willing to reduce capital requirements accordingly. But dealers said they fear regulators may insist on an airtight netting agreement that is impossible to design. ""One problem is that there has never been a major default in the swaps market. So we don't know if any of the swap arrangements will really stand up in court,"" said one bank official."
more pressure urged for asia to take u.s. beef,livestock carcass trade,"Congressmen from beef producing states and representatives of the U.S. livestock industry urged the Reagan administration to press Japan and South Korea to open up their markets to imports of beef. Testifying at a House subcommittee hearing on livestock issues, Rep. Hal Daub (R-Nebr.), said the administration should push hard for greater beef imports by Japan and South Korea. Daub was joined by several other lawmakers. U.S. assistant trade representative Suzanne Earley, replied ""we're not going to let Japan off the hook, or Korea."" She noted trade representative Clayton Yeutter met with a senior Korean official last week on the beef issue, and that Yeutter and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng will visit Tokyo in April for discussions on farm trade issues. Japan maintains a quota on beef imports, set at 58,400 tonnes high quality beef in fiscal 1987. South Korea has banned beef imports but there are indications Seoul may bow to U.S. pressure and allow some imports soon, industry officials said. In testimony today, Tom Cook, director of industry affairs for the National Cattlemens Association said ""the Congress, administration and the industry must take a strong, tough and united stand to impress the Japanese that we mean business and that we expect them to open their markets."""
more soviet grain buying from u.s. tied to price,grain corn wheat,"Whether the Soviet Union will fulfill its buying obligations under the U.S./USSR grains agreement depends entirely on the United States, a Soviet trade official told Reuters. ""How can I tell that we are ready to fulfill the agreement if the United States does not want to offer us grain at competitive prices?"" said Albert Melnikov, deputy trade representative of the Soviet Union to the United States. ""We are in the market for grains, but it is up to the United States to be the seller ... to offer Soviets competitive prices,"" he said in an interview. Melnikov said that the United States has not lived up the agreement by failing to make available to Moscow U.S. grain at prevailing market prices. ""We are being accused of not implementing this agreement. We do not consider we are at fault,"" Melnikov said. Article I in the agreement states that ""purchases/sales of commodities under this Agreement will be made at the market price prevailing for these products at the time of purchase/sale and in accordance with normal commercial terms."" ""The United States should supply to the Soviet Union definite quantities of grain at competitive prices ... Is the United States ready to supply this?"" he said. The Soviet official said that near-term corn demand has been met by the recent Soviet purchases of U.S. corn, which he confirmed at 1.5 mln tonnes, but said that if U.S. corn prices remain competitive, the Soviets will buy more if they need it. Wheat buying, however, is a different story, Melnikov said. ""If the United States is interested in selling its wheat, then they must offer competitive prices, and it's up to the United States to decide how these competitive prices will be offered,"" he said. Last year's U.S. offer of subsidized wheat to the Soviets was rejected because of an insufficient subsidy, Melnikov said. He said that at the time of the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy offer, U.S. wheat prices were 26 dlrs over world levels."
american farm bureau opposes farm bill changes,grain wheat oilseed soybean,"The directors of the American Farm Bureau, the nation's largest farm organization, voted Tuesday to urge Congress to leave the 1985 farm bill in place without alterations. ""We are solidly opposed to opening up the 1985 farm bill,"" said Dean Kleckner, president. ""The current farm bill has been in place for just a little over a year and in our judgment there is more to be gained at the present time from maintaining the legislation. ""Several independent studies ... indicate the 1985 farm bill is better on balance than any of the alternatives being advanced,"" Kleckner said. The Farm Bureau also urged Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng to adjust the loan rate for 1987 crop soybeans as much as he deems possible under the farm bill to keep soybeans competitive in the world market. A Farm Bureau proposal suggests that producers should be eligible for supplemental payments in the form of PIK certificates for the difference between 5.02 dlrs a bushel and the new loan rate. The organization also urged Lyng to authorize deficiency payments to farmers who were unable to plant 1987 winter wheat because of adverse weather."
"yeutter seeks stronger taiwan, s.korea currencies",money-fx trade,"U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said he hoped the U.S. dollar would continue to decline in relation to the currencies of Taiwan and South Korea as a way to improve the U.S. trade picture. Testifying before the House Appropriations subcommittee which must approve his agency's 1988 budget, he said, ""In my judgment economic factors justify a continued decline."" Asked by a committee member if he expected a further decline, and how much, Yeutter said the Taiwan and South Korean currencies should be adjusted to reflect ""positive factors"" in their economies."

allis-chalmers <ah> proposes restructuring,acq earn,"Allis-Chalmers Corp said it asked lenders and other groups to approve a restructuring plan that would cause a dilution of the company's existing common stock. The company said it would sell all of its businesses other than the American Air Filter business, make a public financing of more than 100 mln dlrs and pay part of the currently outstanding debt with the proceeds. Under the plan, which was presented to institutional lenders, the company's unions and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp, ""substantial amounts"" of institutional debt would be converted to common stock of the restructured company. Allis-Chalmers said it will exchange existing preferred stock for common. The exchange of the institutional debt and preferred stock for common equity will cause a ""resulting dilution of the existing common stock,"" Allis-Chalmers said in a statement. Under the plan, holders of existing common would hold about 15 pct of the restructured common stock. Holders of existing preferred would hold about 35 pct of the new common. Allis-Chalmers said its only alternative to the plan is bankruptcy. The restructuring must be approved by creditors, common and preferred holders,and present and former employees. Allis-Chalmers said a bankruptcy filing ""appears to represent the company's only alternative if agreement upon the terms of the plan cannot be reached."" The spokesman said in response to an inquiry that he was not aware of any extraordinary charge against earnings that would result from the restructuring. ""It is too early to talk about a charge"" because the plan must still be approved by the lenders and unions, he said. Also under the plan, payments to Allis-Chalmers' private lenders would be deferred. Trade payables and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business will be met. Payment of health benefits for active and retired employees would be made ""at substantially reduced levels."" Allis-Chalmers, once one of the leading farm equipment companies, sold all of its farm equipment operations to Deutz of West Germany for 107 mln dlrs, leaving the company with businesses in lift trucks, air conditioning, fluids handling and solid materials processing. Last year, Allis-Chalmers sold the lift truck business to AC Material Handling Co of Columbus, Ohio. Under the restructuring plan, Allis-Chalmers will sell its solid materials processing and fluids handling businesses. Solid materials processing, which makes equipment to crush stones for highway construction, accounted for 288 mln dlrs of Allis-Chalmers's total 1985 revenues of 886 mln dlrs. The company will also sell its fluids handling operations, which makes pumps and valves. That business accounted for 196 mln dlrs of the company's 1985 revenues. Allis-Chalmers in 1986 reported a net loss of 8.6 mln dlrs, or 1.09 dlrs a share. In 1985, the company lost 168.4 mln dlrs, or 12.27 dlrs a share. The company's last profit was in 1980, when it earned 52.4 mln dlrs on sales of 2.1 billion dlrs."

In its weekly petroleum status report, the Energy Department agency said distillate demand was down 2.1 pct in the period to 3.37 mln bpd from 3.44 mln a year earlier. Gasoline demand averaged 6.60 mln bpd, up 2.4 pct from 6.44 mln last year, while residual fuel demand was 1.47 mln bpd, up 1.9 pct from 1.44 mln, the EIA said. Domestic crude oil production was estimated at 8.38 mln bpd, down 8.7 pct from 9.18 mln a year ago, and gross daily crude imports (excluding those for the SPR) averaged 4.11 mln bpd, up 36.9 pct from three mln, the EIA said. Refinery crude runs in the four weeks were 12.21 mln bpd, up 2.2 pct from 12 mln a year earlier, it said. Year-to-date figures will not become available until March 26 when EIA's Petroleum Supply Monthly data for January 1987 becomes available, the agency said."
"usda would scrap cotton, rice, bean price floors",grain cotton rice oilseed soybean,"The package of proposed farm policy changes that the Reagan administration sent to Congress today includes a provision that would eliminate minimum price support levels for upland cotton, rice and soybeans. The package, obtained by Reuters, also includes a provision, outlined in advance by USDA officials, that would increase the annual permissible cut in the basic price support levels for all major crops to 10 pct from five pct. Under current law, the basic support prices for upland cotton, rice and soybeans between 1987 and 1990 cannot be cut below 50 cents per lb, 6.50 dlrs per hundredweight and 4.50 dlrs per bushel, respectively. USDA's intention to propose scrapping price floors for cotton, rice and soybeans had not been disclosed previously."

Unsmoothed figures show a deficit of 162 mln dlrs for January against 107 mln, revised from 75 mln for December 1986 and 575 mln in January 1986. The smoothed series -- adjusted to iron out random fluctuations -- shows a widening surplus on merchandise trade to 46 mln from a surplus of 33 mln, revised from 43 mln dlrs in December and a 71 mln deficit in the a year ago period. Exports were 905 mln dlrs against 929 mln, revised from 971 mln in December and 816 mln a year earlier, while imports fell to 858 mln from 895 mln, revised from 928 mln in December and 888 mln in January 1986. Unadjusted merchandise figures show a surplus of 53 mln dlrs vs 141 mln, revised from 203 mln surplus in December 1986 and a 323 mln deficit a year earlier. The deficit on invisibles on unsmoothed figures eased to 215 mln dlrs from 248 mln, revised from 277 mln in December and 252 mln in January 1986.

unusually dry weather affects china's agriculture,grain wheat ship,"Abnormally warm and dry weather over most parts of China is seriously affecting crops, the New China News Agency said. It said the drought has made rice planting difficult in eight provinces, including Guangxi, Sichuan and Hunan. Plant diseases and insect pests have increased in wheat-producing areas, it said. The agency said some areas of Guangxi, Hubei, Shanxi and other provinces have been suffering a drought for more than seven months. The agency said the dry weather had reduced the amount of water stored by more than 20 pct compared with last March, lowered the water level of many rivers, reduced hydroelectric power supplies and caused water shortages for industry and consumers. The upper reaches of the Yangtze are at their lowest levels in a century, causing many ships to run aground and making harbour manoeuvres difficult, it said. The drought has also increased the number of forest fires. More than 1,000 fires in southern China had destroyed 13,340 hectares of forest by mid-February, it said."

Japan Line's cumulative debt was 68.98 billion yen at the end of September, which exceeded shareholders' equities and reserves totalling 63.40 billion. In December, Japan Line asked banks to shelve repayment of about 124 billion yen in outstanding loans and about 153 billion in loans to its subsidiaries. Japan Line said then that the yen's steep rise and the world shipping recession had hit the company hard. The Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun said today that IBJ and three other banks plan to abandon a total of 16 billion yen in loans to Japan Line and a group of creditor banks plans to buy seven billion yen of new Japan Line shares. The spokesman for IBJ, Japan Line's largest creditor, said the package may write off part of the outstanding loans and will be worked out before long. Commenting on the article, he said the details of the package have not yet been settled."

thailand reduces main rice crop projection,grain rice,"Thailand's main paddy crop is expected to fall to 15.4 mln tonnes in the 1986/87 (Nov/Oct) season from a previous 15.68 mln estimate in November and an actual 17.35 mln a year ago, the Thai Rice Mills Association said. It said a joint field survey late last month by the association, the Commerce Ministry and the Bank of Thailand indicated that paddy output in Thailand's northeast region is lower than expected because of a drought in several provinces. The association said rice growing areas in Nakhon Ratchasima, Chaiyaphum, Khon Kaen and Mahasarakam were especially affected by low rainfalls in the second half of 1986. It said last November that the drought reduced total national areas sown with paddy to some 8.25 mln hectares this year, down from 8.84 mln a year ago. The main crop represents about 85 pct of Thailand's paddy output."
"new currency problem seen among u.s, europe, japan",money-fx dlr yen,"The highly visible drama involving the yen's sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the fact that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major European currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange rate distortions, Japanese and European research officials said. The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statements by the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations, told Reuters the currency movements of the past two years are also creating a fundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up new trade tensions and imbalances. Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are already changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan- European Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe. In many ways, not least in terms of rare international cooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact between the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut down the value of the dollar was a historic one. But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major currency movements which lay bare the real picture, in which the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not necessarily central significance, the officials said. The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took place, the dollar was already on its way down. The agreement simply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely. ""You have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now, and that was well before Plaza,"" he said. On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at 263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was 242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the dollar trend has been down, down, down. Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The European currencies are moving back up against the yen. The close relationship between exchange rates and trade flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is changing. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen. This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus. Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of of sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years. Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12 pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports and 21 pct for imports in yen terms. ""The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a tremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit sold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important to them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is laying the golden egg,"" said de Hora. The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year in Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its start from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade. The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than U.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate imbalance, and which will cause problems. ""This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But therefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive edge,"" said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. ""If you want my objective view, I don't expect a drastic improvement in our trade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports, and this year we may have to do so again,"" he said."

taiwan foreign exchange reserves hit new high,reserves trade,"Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves hit a new high of more than 51 billion U.S. Dlrs on March 4, compared with 50 billion in mid-February and 25.1 billion a year earlier, the central bank said. Bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters the increase came mainly from the bank's purchases of more than one billion U.S. Dlrs on the local interbank market between February 18 and March 4. He said the rise showed signs of slowing, however, because Taiwan has liberalised import policy and expects its trade surplus to decline over the next few months as a result. Chang declined to predict how high the reserves might rise, but local economists have forecast they will hit 60 billion U.S. Dlrs by the end of 1987. In January, Taiwan reduced import tariffs of up to 50 pct on some 1,700 foreign products. It had been under growing U.S. Pressure to cut its 1986 record 13.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the U.S. Taiwan's 1985 surplus with the U.S. Was 10.2 billion, according to official statistics. Wang Chang-Ming, Vice Chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development, told Reuters the government is planning another round of deep tariff cuts in the second half of this year. The reserves could support imports of more than two years for Taiwan, compared with about three months for Japan and the U.S."

u.k. fourth quarter trade deficit 2.6 billion stg,trade bop,"Britain had a visible trade deficit of 2.6 billion stg in the fourth quarter of 1986 against a revised deficit of 2.9 billion in the third quarter, official statistics show. Seasonally-adjusted figures issued by the Central Statistical Office (CSO) show the current account was in deficit by 760 mln stg against an upwardly revised third quarter shortfall of 930 mln. For 1986 as a whole, visible trade was in deficit by 8.3 billion stg, sharply up from 1985's 2.2. Billion shortfall and a 4.4 billion deficit in 1984. Preliminary figures for invisible transactions in the fourth quarter show a surplus 1.8 billion stg to give an estimated surplus for 1986 of 7.2 billion. The fourth quarter figure was in line with CSO projections released on Friday. The third quarter invisibles surplus was revised down to 1.9 billion stg from 2.25 billion. In 1985 the invisibles surplus was 5.1 billion stg. The reduced deficit on visible trade in the fourth quarter was due to an increase in the surplus on oil of 200 mln stg and a reduction in the non-oil trade deficit of 100 mln, the CSO said. However, 1986's surplus on oil trade was 4.0 billion stg lower than in 1985, while the deficit on non-oil trade increased by 2.1 billion. The figures were broadly in line with market expectations. The CSO stressed that figures for invisible transactions, particularly for the most recent quarters are liable to substantial revisions as later information becomes available."
"french intervention rate cut likely, dealers say",money-fx interest,"The Bank of France is likely to cut its money market intervention rate by up to a quarter point at the start of next week. This follows a steady decline in the call money rate over the past 10 days and signals from the Finance Ministry that the time is ripe for a fall, dealers said. The call money rate peaked at just above nine pct ahead of the meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Five industrial countries and Canada on February 22, which restored considerable stability to foreign exchanges after several weeks of turbulence. The call money rate dropped to around 8-3/8 pct on February 23, the day after the Paris accord, and then edged steadily down to eight pct on February 27 and 7-3/4 pct on March 3, where it has now stabilised. Dealers said the Bank of France intervened to absorb liquidity to hold the rate at 7-3/4 pct. While call money has dropped by well over a percentage point, the Bank of France's money market intervention rate has remained unchanged since January 2, when it was raised to eight pct from 7-1/4 pct in a bid to stop a franc slide. The seven-day repurchase rate has also been unchanged at 8-3/4 since it was raised by a half-point on January 5. The Bank of France has begun using the seven-day repurchase rate to set an upper indicator for money market rates, while using the intervention rate to set the floor. Sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said that he would be happy to see an interest rate cut, and dealers said any fall in the intervention rate was most likely to come when the Bank of France buys first category paper next Monday, although an earlier cut could not be excluded. A cut in the seven-day repurchase rate could come as early as tomorrow morning, banking sources said. They said recent high interest rates have encouraged an acceleration in foreign funds returning to France, discouraging the authorities from making a hasty rate cut. But they also pointed out that money supply is broadly back on target, giving scope for a small fall in rates. M-3 money supply, the government's key aggregate, finished 1986 within the government's three to five pct growth target, rising 4.6 pct compared with seven pct in 1985."

It again bought bills for resale to the market on April 2 at a rate of 10-15/16 pct. Earlier this morning, it bought 17 mln stg of bills at the same rate and for resale on the same date. The Bank has thus given a total of 37 mln stg so far today, which leaves the bulk of a 1.15 billion stg shortage still in the system. Dealers noted that money market rates again eased this morning and the Bank may have refused bill offers from the discount houses at rates below its established dealing levels."

royal dutch/shell u.s. earnings sharply lower,earn crude,"Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD.AS> earnings for 1986 from the U.S. Fell sharply because of difficult market conditions, lower crude and gas prices and also due to different accounting methods, Shell chairman Peter Holmes said. The Shell Oil dollar net income fell 47 pct in the year, while the additional effect of currency movements reduced the contribution to group net income by 57 pct to 472 mln stg. The group earlier reported a drop in net income for the year to 2.54 billion stg from 3.03 billion previously, with lower crude prices outweighing the effect of increased sales by volume. Although the figures were lower, they were nonetheless at the top end of market forecasts. Shell Transport and Trading Plc <SC.L> shares, the U.K. Arm of the group, rose to 11.39 stg from a close last night of 11.06 stg. Analysts noted that a general collapse in exploration and production volumes was partially offset by earnings from chemicals rising to 462 mln stg from 205 mln in 1985. Also, a windfall tax credit and lower than expected currency losses had added about 100 mln stg onto fourth quarter results, which was the main reason for the figures exceeding forecasts, industry analyst Chris Rowland of Barclays de Zoete Wedd noted. However, he added there could well be a sharp fall in performance in the first quarter of 1987, due to the improbability that the group would be able to repeat the high refining and marketing margins of first quarter 1986. The impact of recovering oil prices would come through faster on the downstream side than on the upstream as such a high proportion of upstream activity centred on gas, which typically reacted to oil price changes with about a half-year lag, analysts said. Holmes said that in the upstream U.S. Sector the third quarter of 1986 had been the worst of all. Only two of the oil majors had managed to make a profit in the period, with Shell Oil being one of them. The decrease in U.S. Earnings had been accentuated by tax rates but the group had increased share to become volume market leader, Holmes added. Continued low crude oil prices would continue to subdue U.S. Exploration activity. ""Exploration is currently pretty flat. We are going to go on, but at 16-18 dlrs there will be no massive upturn,"" he said. A renewal of exploration in high cost areas of the North Sea and the U.S. Requires prices of around 25 dlrs a barrel. Ultimately this would lead to a rise in U.S. Imports. ""If you are not exploring you are not going to find anything,"" he noted. U.S. Oil production had dropped some half mln barrels a day (bbd) in 1986 and would continue to fall if the price stayed below 20 dlrs a barrel. This favored OPEC's attempts to stabilise prices, as the lower the price the more likelihood there was of non-OPEC marginal production shutting down. ""OPEC has done pretty extraordinarily well...Everything is moving in (its) direction,"" he added."
western canada hurt by international forces,grain wheat copper,"Western Canada's resource-based economy is being hurt by international market forces and there is little Ottawa can do about it, Finance Minister Michael Wilson said. ""If you can tell me how we can get the international energy price up and how we can get the price for copper up and how we can get the price for wheat up, then we will listen,"" Wilson told the House of Comnons Finance Committee. Although under pressure from oil companies and wheat farmers for help in battling depressed commodity prices, Wilson said it has to be recognized the area was a ""prisoner of market forces outside the boundaries of this country."" Wilson, appearing before the committee to discuss the government's spending estimates released earlier this week, said the government is doing what it can in the region, citing more than 3.5 billion dlrs in aid for western agriculture. ""Those resources are a reflection of very real concerns on our part in dealing with a very difficult problem,"" Wilson said in response to questions about management of the economy from opposition party members. He said the long term answer for depressed regions of the country was reaching a free trade pact with the United States, which he claimed would improve the outlook for Western Canada."
soybean group head urges usda action on loan,oilseed soybean,"The Agriculture Department must make a decision soon on how to change the current U.S. soybean loan or more soybeans will continue to be forfeited to the government and foreign soybean production will increase, the president of the American Soybean Association, ASA, said. ""The USDA will have to bite the bullet one way or another ... USDA can dodge and dart around it (the soybean loan) as much as they want, but they have to eventually address this problem,"" David Haggard, ASA president, told Reuters. USDA is not offering any new soybean loan options, and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng has not consulted ASA on the soybean loan, Haggard said. ""I don't know if USDA is really very serious about addressing the soybean loan problem,"" he said. At ASA's annual winter board of directors meeting here, ASA leaders refused to change their official position on the loan -- still calling for income support at 5.02 dlrs. The association backs current bills of Rep. Bill Emerson, R-Mo. and Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., which call for either a 5.02 marketing loan or a producer option payment. Haggard said he does not know what chances the ASA-backed proposals have but said, ""in all honesty, we do not want to see the farm bill be torn apart."" He said if USDA feels it cannot withdraw its opposition to a market loan, there are still numerous ways the USDA could change the loan without new legislation. Making the loan partially in certificates which would not have to be paid back would be one option, he said."

u.s. commerce's ortner says yen undervalued,money-fx dlr yen,"Commerce Dept. undersecretary of economic affairs Robert Ortner said that he believed the dollar at current levels was fairly priced against most European currencies. In a wide ranging address sponsored by the Export-Import Bank, Ortner, the bank's senior economist also said he believed that the yen was undervalued and could go up by 10 or 15 pct. ""I do not regard the dollar as undervalued at this point against the yen,"" he said. On the other hand, Ortner said that he thought that ""the yen is still a little bit undervalued,"" and ""could go up another 10 or 15 pct."" In addition, Ortner, who said he was speaking personally, said he thought that the dollar against most European currencies was ""fairly priced."" Ortner said his analysis of the various exchange rate values was based on such economic particulars as wage rate differentiations. Ortner said there had been little impact on U.S. trade deficit by the decline of the dollar because at the time of the Plaza Accord, the dollar was extremely overvalued and that the first 15 pct decline had little impact. He said there were indications now that the trade deficit was beginning to level off. Turning to Brazil and Mexico, Ortner made it clear that it would be almost impossible for those countries to earn enough foreign exchange to pay the service on their debts. He said the best way to deal with this was to use the policies outlined in Treasury Secretary James Baker's debt initiative."

farmers concerned about british sugar ownership,sugar acq,"The National Farmers Union, NFU, remains concerned about the future ownership of British Sugar despite last week's decision by the government to block bids from Italy's Gruppo Ferruzzi and Britain's Tate & Lyle Plc. The union's sugar beet committee met yesterday to consider the implications of a government Monopolies and Merger Commission, MMC, report issued last week. ""We are still concerned about S and W Berisford being long-term owners of British Sugar,"" a spokesman said. ""We do not view Berisford as providing the long-term stability we want."" The Trade and Industry Secretary accepted a recommendation last week by the MMC that it block a bid by Tate and Lyle for S and W Berisford Plc and stop Gruppo Ferruzzi buying a majority of British Sugar, owned by Berisford. Union officials believe a new bid for the monopoly beet processor is now likely. ""We are looking again at the undertakings that we have demanded of existing bidders and which we would seek of any future bidders,"" the spokesman said. The NFU, which represents Britain's 11,500 sugar beet growers, is also taking legal advice on particular paragraphs in the MMC report which it says need further explanation."
"dutch growth likely to slow, jobless rise in 1987",gnp jobs,"Leaks of a major Dutch official economic forecast due to be published on Monday indicate reduced economic growth and a renewed rise in unemployment this year, political and market sources say. Concern over an anticipated fall in Dutch competitiveness this year against a background of an average 2-1/2 pct wage increase, zero inflation and a firm guilder has triggered some calls for a change in monetary policy to help boost growth. But whatever the government's response, the central bank will stick to its policy of keeping the guilder firm, they say. The official forecasting agency Centraal Planbureau (CPB) publishes its 1987 outlook at the start of a week which will also see a key parliamentary debate on government finances and the economy. Merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson - in an estimate reflecting general sentiment - said last month that Dutch economic growth was now seen around one pct. Domestic consumer spending is not expected to offset the decline in export growth caused by slowing growth in West Germany, the main Dutch trading partner, and the lower dollar, Pierson said in its February economic outlook. The latest growth forecasts are well below a 1.5 to two pct growth figure seen by the CPB early last month and forecasts of 2.5 pct economic growth in 1987 made last September. The fall in unemployment is bottoming out and the government has already admitted it will not meet its goal of reducing unemployment by an annual 50,000 from 1986 to 1990. Some analysts and industry leaders have questioned central bank policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the mark and if necessary keeping interest rates up to support the guilder. Employers federation NCW chairman Fred Lempers criticised the guilder's revaluation in line with the West German mark in last January's European Monetary System (EMS) realignment and expressed concern over its effect on competitiveness. But the employers federation VNO noted the Dutch economy had become more competitive since 1980 and the fall of the dollar was affecting this gain more than the EMS realignment. Some analysts also question the central bank's decision not to copy the latest Bundesbank discount rate cut and instead lower money market rates and abolish a credit quota surcharge. Central bank president Wim Duisenberg has defended the move saying the bank had adjusted the rates with the most impact on the money market, noting ""the (4.5 pct) discount rate is at the moment not the most important Dutch rate because it is already far below the market rates."" Central bank officials say the heavy dependence on trade of the Dutch economy requires a stable exchange rate, and interest rate policies serve that goal. Analysts noted a large capital outflow from the Netherlands recently as foreign investments in Dutch stock are being sold to take profits. Loosening the tie between the guilder and the mark would reduce international confidence in the guilder and make it more dificult to attract foreign capital, they said, noting Dutch interest rates rose sharply when the guilder was not revalued completely in line with the mark in a 1983 EMS realignment. Many Dutch banks have reacted favourably to the decision not to copy the last German discount rate cut, but Pierson warned it could actually add to uncertainty over the guilder. Some analysts noted friction between the Finance Ministry and the central bank, with Finance Minister Onno Ruding having said before the Bundesbank discount rate cut he favoured lower Dutch rates but that the Germans should move first. One analyst said Ruding wanted to bring interest rates down to reduce the government debt burden. A Finance Ministry spokesman said lower interest rates were needed but denied any suggestion of conflicting views between the ministry and the central bank. ""The cabinet's policy is steady, the guilder has to stay with the mark,"" he said."

world grain trade recovery may be underway,grain wheat,"World grain trade could be turning the corner and heading toward recovery in the 1986-87 season, a Cargill, Inc. analyst said. Writing in the March issue of the Cargill Bulletin, David Rogers of Cargill's Commodity Marketing Division cited a gradual rise in world wheat trade in recent months, with a slow rise in wheat prices after recent historic lows. He said the wheat trade, because wheat can be produced in many nations, is a good barometer of world grain trade and could lead to more activity in other grain markets. Rogers said that with world grain prices at their lowest level in over a quarter of a century in real terms, demand has begun to rise while producing nations are re-examining their expensive price-support policies and reducing planted acres."
nppc delegates approve disease and drug programs,livestock hog carcass,"Delegates from the National Pork Producers Council, NPPC, yesterday approved programs for control and eradication of pseudorabies and establishment of a national safe drug use program. The delegate body, attending the American Pork Congress in Indianapolis, approved a pseudorabies control and eradication program at the state level after a recommendation from NPPC's PRV (pseudorabies virus) oversight committee. The PRV committee received results of a three year, five state pilot project which had a 97.5 pct success rate in eradication of the disease within 116 hog herds. The project was jointly funded by the USDA and NPPC. ""Primarily it (the program) allows individual states to deal with their own problems according to a timetable that suits them best,"" Mike Wehler, member of the NPPC's PRV oversight committee said. In regards to safe drug use, the delegates approved a plan asking that NPPC be active in establishing a national safe drug use program. The program would establish better relationships between producers and veterinarians and eventually lead to a quality assurance program in pork production, according to the plan. ""This program basically communicates to the FDA that we are concerned about safe drug use and will do our part to use drugs safely, if FDA will allow the same policy to continue in effect,"" Wehler said."

fed's johnson stresses price stability,gnp trade,"Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson said that maintaining price stability was critical to achieving non-inflationary economic growth in the world and said that progress was being made. ""It is worth reiterating that the Federal Reserve's promotion of price stability is critical to the successful implementation of virtually all of the important ingredients for growth,"" he told the Eastern Economic Association. Johnson said initial progress has been made on a variety of fronts. ""Federal Reserve monetary policy, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation, the G-6 agreement, and the Baker debt initiative for example all have moved us in the right direction,"" he said. G-6 is comprised of U.S., Britain, France, Japan, West Germany and Canada. On the budget deficit, Johnson said meeting precise numerical goals was less important than a continuing commitment toward slowing the growth of federal spending. There was evidence deficits as a pct of Gross National Product were declining and would continue to drop, he said. But Johnson warned against reliance on inflow of foreign capital to finance investment and the budget deficit and keep interest rates stable. ""This situation, however, cannot continue indefinitely. Sooner or later progress must be made in controlling excessive federal spending,"" he said. A disinflationary monetary policy should continue to be the main objective of the Fed, Johnson said. He also said a more stable and sustainable alignment of exchange rates was needed for long-term growth. On the trade deficit, Johnson warned against ""quick fix"" solutions, which he identified as excessive dollar depreciation or protectionist trade legislation. ""What is important is that we attempt to maintain healthy returns to capital and adopt policies encouraging genuine economic growth,"" he said. Such an approach would finance the trade deficit but allow for its gradual resolution over time."

Asked for reaction, a Treasury spokesman said officials were aware of Ortner's comments but had no intention of making any comment on them. Ortner, who stressed he was expressing personal views, said he thought the U.S. dollar was ""fairly priced"" against most European currencies and added ""I do not regard the dollar as undervalued at this point against the yen,"" he said. But the yen should go up 10 or 15 pct in value, Ortner said, because it is undervalued against the dollar. The United States and major trade allies West Germany, France, Britain, Japan and Canada met recently in Paris to discuss maintaining stability in international currency values."
yeutter says budget cut key to better u.s. trade,trade money-fx,"A reduction of the U.S. federal budget deficit will be needed to help eliminate the nation's huge trade deficit, U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter said. Speaking to the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Yeutter said ""Capital and trade flows are clearly inter-releated now. ""Unless we get the budget deficit down, we will not get the trade deficit down."" He did not elaborate on his views of the linkages between the two deficits. Private analysts have said that the financing of large U.S. budget deficits requires heavy capital inflows from overseas investors through purchases of U.S. Treasury and, to a lesser extent, other U.S. securities as well. ""We'll make some progress in reducing the 170 billion dlr trade deficit in 1987, but there's still a long way to go,"" Yeutter said. He said the problem must be approached on many fronts and focus most strongly on U.S. and overseas fiscal and monetary policies to foster economic growth, U.S. competitiveness and the establishment of a ""level playing field"" for trade. The U.S. trade representative said the Federal Reserve under Chairman Paul Volcker has done its part to improve the trade situation by getting interest rates down. On the fiscal side, Yeutter said ""the budget deficit is still our biggest problem"" and there has not been enough progress toward reducing that deficit. In the international area, he said that ""our major trading partners could still do more to stimulate domestic growth."" Commenting on Japan, which is running around a 80 billion dlr trade surplus with the United States, Yeutter said ""Japan is just not doing the job on the import side."" Yeutter declined to comment on statements relating to the dollar made earlier today by Commerce Dept undersecretary of Economic Affairs Robert Ortner. In a Washington address to an Export-Import Bank sponsored meeting, Ortner said he believed the dollar at current levels was fairly priced against most European currencies, but that the yen is 10 or 15 pct undervalued. ""The market will determine the dollar's proper value in the end,"" Yeutter said. However, he added that, if the U.S. and other nations do not take the necessary steps to cut the U.S. trade deficit, ""the dollar will be the equalizer."" Yeutter said there is no quick fix to the trade problem and any resort to such tactics as protectionist trade legislation or trade restrictions poses real dangers. He said ""there's relatively little that Congress can do to legislate a solution to the trade problem."" Protectionist legislation will only provoke retaliation by U.S. trading partners, Yeutter said. ""There is no doubt in my mind about the willingness of our trading partners to retaliate against unfair trade legislation,"" Yeutter said, adding that policy flexibility is essential in solving international trade problems."
"new currency problem seen among u.s, europe, japan",money-fx dlr yen,"The highly visible drama involving the yen's sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the fact that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major European currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange rate distortions, Japanese and European research officials said. The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statements by the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations, told Reuters the currency movements of the past two years are also creating a fundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up new trade tensions and imbalances. Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are already changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan- European Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe. In many ways, not least in terms of rare international cooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact between the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut down the value of the dollar was a historic one. But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major currency movements which lay bare the real picture, in which the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not necessarily central significance, the officials said. The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took place, the dollar was already on its way down. The agreement simply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely. ""You have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now, and that was well before Plaza,"" he said. On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at 263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was 242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the dollar trend has been down, down, down. Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The European currencies are moving back up against the yen. The close relationship between exchange rates and trade flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is changing. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen. This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus. Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of of sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years. Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12 pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports and 21 pct for imports in yen terms. ""The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a tremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit sold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important to them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is laying the golden egg,"" said de Hora. The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year in Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its start from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade. The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than U.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate imbalance, and which will cause problems. ""This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But therefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive edge,"" said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. ""If you want my objective view, I don't expect a drastic improvement in our trade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports, and this year we may have to do so again,"" he said. RE"
australia attacks u.s. gatt farm rules exemption,trade sugar cotton groundnut oilseed,"Australia accused the U.S. of increasing protectionism on agricultural products and called for an end to Washington's special 32-year exemption from certain GATT rules on agricultural trade. Robert Arnott, Australia's delegate to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), made the appeal at a special annual meeting which reviews the 1955 U.S. waiver. ""Australia today said the United States' goals of reducing U.S. barriers to agricultural trade were being contradicted by actions which in fact increased protection in trade in agriculture,"" the Australian delegation said in a statement. ""The United States section 22 waiver is one of the basic flaws in the GATT coverage of agriculture,"" Arnott told the meeting. Arnott said the waiver had continually been used as a justification for ""dubious protective measures"" by the U.S. He listed a recent Dairy Export Incentive Program and steps to close the U.S. sugar market to imports. He also told Reuters the waiver allowed Washington to impose quotas on imports of farm products where it had domestic support programs. This covered imports of dairy products, peanuts, cotton and sugar. Asked to comment, Michael Samuels, U.S. ambassador to the GATT, told Reuters: ""These charges have been made since the very beginning. The waiver is part of domestic U.S. agricultural policy, part of our law when we joined the GATT"". ""We have agreed to put the waiver on the table during the Uruguay Round and invite other countries to do the same with their programs. We can negotiate them all,"" Samuels added. Ninety-two nations are taking part in the four-year Uruguay round of talks launched in Punta del Este last September. Bargaining in agricultural goods and services (banking, tourism, insurance) is included for the first time as well as manufactured goods."
house 0/92 farm proposal seen sparking debate,grain wheat,"A House Agriculture Committee meeting later today to draft a disaster aid bill is expected to spark a debate between lawmakers who want to expand the 0/92, or ""de-coupling,"" provision to cover feedgrains, and those who oppose 0/92 or want it severely limited, Congressional sources said. The disaster aid bill as it now stands calls for a one-year 0/92 pilot program for 1987 crop wheat and the 1988 winter wheat crop. The bill would allow farmers to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments. The administration has strongly urged that the bill be expanded to feedgrains and to more than one year. It is difficult to tell in what form the 0/92 provision will emerge from the committee, the sources said. Proponents of an expansion of 0/92 maintain there are large estimated cost savings of such a bill -- ranging from estimates by the administration of 200 to 500 mln dlrs. Opposition to a reopening of the 1985 farm bill at this time is the major reason cited by those against an expansion of the bill, committee staffers said. The 0/92 plan is scheduled to be discussed at 1530 EST. A conflicting floor vote delayed the start of the meeting, and staffers said it may have to be delayed even until next week. Such a delay would not bode well for proponents of an expanded 0/92 program, since spring planting in many areas of the country will be underway in the next few weeks and signup for the 1987 wheat and feedgrains program ends March 30. Farmers are now making their planting decisions, so something has to be done quickly if a 0/92 program is to be implemented, an Agriculture Department source said. An expansion of 0/92 to feedgrains was opposed in last week's subcommittee hearing on the bill, with subcommittee chairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan., saying that more study of the consequences of decoupling on feedgrains plantings was necessary. Major commodity groups, including the National Corn Growers, the American Farm Bureau and the National Cattlemen's Association, have voiced strong opposition to 0/92. But proponents of an expanded 0/92 argue that the bill currently is not equitable for all grains producers, so it should be extended to other crops. There will be difficulty in limiting 0/92 to wheat, said Gene Moos, aide to house majority leader Tom Foley, D-Wash. Projected cost savings, in the current atmosphere of try to decrease farm expenditures, would also be hard to ignore in the debate to expand the 0/92 application, Moos said. Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Tex., may be planning to introduce a bill to restrict 0/92 to only 1987 crop wheat, with the argument that now is not the time to vote in favor of any major changes in the farm bill. ""Stenholm's bill is not a rejection of 0/92, only of the timing,"" a congressional staff member said. Rep. Arland Stangeland (R-Minn.) is reported to have an amendment to expand the 0/92 provision to 1987 and 1988 feedgrains."

According to the department's Export Sales Report covering transactions in the week ended February 26, China has outstanding wheat commitments for the 1986/87 season of 30,000 tonnes and 420,000 tonnes for delivery in the 1987/88 season.

cuban cattle threatened by drought,livestock l-cattle carcass sugar,"Over 750,000 head of cattle are suffering the effects of a severe shortage of feed as a result of a prolonged drought in the normally rich sugar and cattle producing province of Camaguey, the newspaper Granma reported. The province produces 23 pct of Cuba's beef and is the island's number two province in milk production. Granma said 20,000 head of cattle are now in imminent danger. The newspaper said a ""cattle emergency"" had been decreed and the cattle are being rounded up. Some 110,000 head have been transferred to the sugar cane conditioning centers where newly harvested cane is cleaned before being sent to the mills. The cattle are being fed the residue left after cleaning the cane stalks. 32,000 head have been sent to nearby provinces of Las Tunas and Ciego de Avila. Despite Cuba's ambitous cattle development plans, beef rationing has been in effect over the past 25 years. In Havana, each Cuban receives approximately 3/4 lb of rationed beef every 18 days. In a major area hit by drought, San Miguel, practically no rain has fallen in the past 14 months. Grazing lands are parched and the region was unable to produce 117,000 tonnes of silage projected in its annual plan. Granma said rainfall over the past year has been less than 50 pct of normal precipitation."
canada dlr driven by foreign buyers - wilson,money-fx can,"Finance Minister Michael Wilson said large inflows of capital into Canada, principally into the country's bond market, is a major reason behind the sharp recovery in the Canadian dollar. He said the inflow of funds, mainly from Japan, Europe and the United States, is the result of ""confidence in the direction this country is going in."" ""That is the reason why the (Canadian) dollar today is higher than 75 cts (U.S.) compared to this time last year (when it was) a little over 69 cts,"" Wilson told the House of Commons daily question period. Figures released this week show foreigners purchased a record 23.1 billion dlrs of Canadian bonds in 1986, more than double the previous year, with Japan investing a record 9.5 billion dlrs in the market. Wilson was responding to opposition party questions about a possible loss of jobs from the rise in Canadian investment abroad. Canadian investment, including the buying of foreign companies, stocks and bonds, rose to 12.53 billion dlrs from 6.19 billion dlrs in 1985. The minister said the flow of funds from abroad would generate many new jobs in Canada."

"pork delegates vote on farm bill, farm credit",livestock carcass,"Delegates from the National Pork Producers Council, NPPC, attending the American Pork Congress in Indianapolis, voted overwhelmingly to recommend the U.S. congress not to change the farm bill. While there are no specific pork items in that legislation, feed grain prices directly affect pork producer profits, the NPPC said. Don Gingerich, a delegate from Iowa, said ""to have unpredictable changes come along periodically makes it very difficult to plan and causes a lot of disruption."" Other members said the farm bill has some imperfections but that's a price pork producers are willing to pay for legislative stability, an NPPC spokesman said. Delegates also passed unanimously a resolution that Congress and the administration should act swiftly to identify problems in the farm credit system. Farm Credit Task Force chairman and newly elected Vice President of the NPPC Ray Hankes, said delegates wanted a program that all commodity groups can work with and bring a resolution to this problem with legislators in Washington. Hankes added that the National Pork Producers Council will work to save farmers and keep credit available, but not to save or create any one credit system."

usda comments on export sales,grain corn oilseed soybean veg-oil soy-oil meal-feed soy-meal cotton,"Corn sales gained 2,494,900 tonnes in the week ended February 26, the highest weekly total since August 1984 and two and three-quarter times the prior week's level, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. In comments on its Export Sales Report, the department said sales of 1.0 mln tonnes to the USSR -- previously reported under the daily reporting system -- were the first sales for delivery to the USSR under the fourth year of the U.S.-USSR Grains Supply Agreement, which began October 1. Japan added 689,700 tonnes to previous purchases and sales to unknown destinations rose by 429,800 tonnes. Wheat sales of 362,400 tonnes for the current season and 151,000 for the 1987/88 season were down by more than half from the previous week's combined sales, it said. Egypt, Japan and Iraq were the major wheat buyers for delivery in the current year, while sales to China decreased by 30,000 tonnes for the current season, but increased by 90,000 tonnes for the 1987/88 season, which begins June 1. Net sales of soybeans totalling 274,200 tonnes equaled the preceding week, but were nearly a third below the four week average. Major increases were for Belgium, South Korea, Mexico and Italy, it said. Soybean cake and meal sales of 103,700 tonnes were 2-3/4 times the previous week's marketing year low, but six pct less than the four week average. Major increases for West Germany, Belgium, Spain, Italy and Australia were partially offset by declines to unknown destinations. Soybean oil sales of 5,400 tonnes were the result of increases for Venezuela and reductions of 500 tonnes for unknown destinations. Combined sales activity in cotton of 75,200 running bales -- 44,700 bales for the current year and 30,500 bales for the 1987/88 bales -- were 56 pct below the prior week's good showing, the department said. Major purchasers for the current season were South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and Thailand, while South Korea and Indonesia were the major buyers for the 1987/88 season, which begins August 1."

house 0/92 plan seen scaled-back to 1987 wheat,grain wheat,"Key members of the House Agriculture committee have agreed to scale-back the 0/92 provision of a pending disaster aid bill to cover only 1987 crop wheat, but a broader 0/92 proposal is likely to be resurrected later, Congressional sources said. The sources said key lawmakers including Reps. Glenn English (D-Okla.), and Dan Glickman (D-Kan.) agreed to support an amendment to be offered next week by Rep. Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) which would limit 0/92 only to producers of 1987 crop winter and spring wheat. This would scale-back the 0/92 provision to the original proposal by English allowing a pilot 0/92 program for 1987 wheat only. That provision was later broadened by the subcommittee to include 1988 crop winter wheat. Under 0/92, a farmer can forego planting a crop but still collect 92 pct of deficiency payments. Earlier today, the House Agriculture committee postponed until next Tuesday a meeting to consider the disaster aid bill and 0/92. The agreement to limit 0/92 to a wheat pilot program follows vocal criticism of the proposal by some influential farm groups who are concerned about the major impact of 0/92, and by members of Congress wary of reopening the farm bill. Congressional sources said there has not been enough time to study the implications of a broad 0/92. ""The timing (of the proposal) is off,"" said one aide to a House Agriculture committee member. However, several Congressional sources said they expect a broader 0/92 provision to emerge again when the House Agriculture committee is faced next month with the need to make spending cuts in the agriculture budget for fiscal 1988 as part of an overall deficit reduction package. Gene Moos, aide to House Majority leader Tom Foley (D-Wash.), predicted agriculture's share of budget cuts may exceed one billion dlrs. A broader 0/92 might be resurrected later because both the Congressional Budget Office and the Reagan administration estimate it would result in significant budget savings. A U.S. Agriculture Department official said 0/92 for all 1987 crops would save 300 to 400 mln dlrs and more than 1.5 billion dlrs over five years. Another factor which could affect the 0/92 debate is the approach of planting season, Congressional sources said. Some officials said it already is late for implementation of a 0/92 in 1987 because farm program signup ends March 31 for wheat and feedgrains. If Congress approved 0/92 later in the year sign-up either would have to be extended or reopened, sources said."
favored trade status for moscow still opposed,trade crude nat-gas,"The Reagan administration wants to encourage expanded trade with the Soviet Union but does not believe Moscow yet warrants most-favored-nation treatment, Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead said. ""It seems to me that more trade between us is better than less trade,"" he told a forum on U.S.-Soviet trade relations. To that end, the administration in January allowed foreign policy controls on the export of oil and gas equipment to the Soviet Union to lapse, he said. Also, Washington and its allies are reviewing remaining export controls in hopes of simplifying the list of prohibited items and speeding up the licensing process, he said. Whitehead said, however, the prefential treatment that comes with most-favored-nation status is out for the moment. U.S. law prohibits most-favored-nation status for countries that restrict emigration and other rights. ""What we have seen so far (in improved rights under Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev) are promising trends,"" he said. But, he added: ""We don't know if they will continue, we don't know how significant they will be."""

brazil debt seen partner to hard sell tactics,coffee oilseed soybean trade sugar cocoa,"Brazil's recent announcement of a suspension in interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign debt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed views among many international economists and commodities analysts that Brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in 1987. The developing world's most indebted nation is also its most prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and soybeans, and might maximize foreign exchange revenue by selling hard on world markets, economists said. ""That sounds like a reasonable strategy. But there is no way they can trade their way out of this situation,"" Aldo Roldan, Vice President for International Services at Chase Econometrics, said. Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle the problems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted world markets, but also had to work to make its position on foreign exchange markets more profitable. ""Domestic costs have increased (due to inflation) and exporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange rates,"" Roldan said. The Chase economist also said commodities markets were depressed and generally did not appear very promising for a country like Brazil, where pure commodities account for some 50 pct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23 billion dlrs. But he added: ""They are always pretty aggressive and they have good foreign marketing channels."" Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be coffee, and even without background pressure from foreign creditors the world's largest producer was expected to hit the market this year with a vengeance. Negotiations between International Coffee Organization (ICO) members to re-establish producer export quotas broke up earlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing each other of intransigence. ""Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations, which others wanted changed,"" one senior coffee dealer said. The dealer, who declined to be named, said Brazil wanted to preserve its market share. At the end of the talks, he said Brazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others would suffer. Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but as yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales, the dealer said. ""If they do come into the market at this level it will go lower and you could breach a dollar, ninety or eighty cents,"" he said. New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 2.29 cents lower Thursday at 104.68 cents a lb, while more distant deliveries fell the six-cent maximum trading limit. President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, Jorio Dauster told a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of the ICO talks on export quotas. Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the focus of possible stepped-up Brazilian marketing efforts. ""They will be more aggressive this year than they have ever been,"" according to Richard Loewy, analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. Loewy believes the foreign debt problem, a good crop, plus difficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the Brazil soybean crop. ""Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and they can't afford to store the crops,"" he said. The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time about large South American crops developing under near ideal conditions towards record yields. ""We are going to see a very rapid decline, earlier than usual, this year in our (U.S.) exports,"" Loewy said. Tommy Eshleman, economist for the American Soybean Association (ASA), said this year's Brazilian soybean harvest could total 18 mln tonnes, versus 13.7 mln last year. Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices are usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the vulnerability of the U.S. crop to bad growing weather. Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a reduction in the U.S. government soybean loan rate, offered to farmers who give crops as collateral, Eshleman said. He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the soybean loan rate, which acts as an effective floor for prices by keeping supplies away from the free market. Farmers can forfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the loan. ""We're getting into a period when they (Brazil) are starting to harvest and starting to export,"" Eshleman said. But he added it will be a while before U.S. exports fall to below 10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently. Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel Burnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much as it can this year because of its economic situation. He said the debt situation was a major consideration. ""The Brazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for storage,"" he added. Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil would make farmers inclined to hold onto crops, Melicias said it would not make a big difference. On other commodity markets, Brazil's selling impact may be muted no matter its need to generate capital. Brazil is faced with a poor 1986/87 sugar harvest, which could limit exports to the world market, analysts said. The country may have oversold and be unable to honor export commitments, and this plus higher domestic demand caused by consumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar, will give it little room to stretch exports, they said. Brazil's other major crop, cocoa, is in its third year of surplus. ""Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it fell, so I don't think they can start throwing out cocoa and find many more markets for it,"" one analyst said. ""If they come out as aggressive sellers, the market would collapse and they can't afford to do that,"" she added."
u.s. senate group urges subsidies for ussr,grain wheat,"A majority of the Senate Agriculture Committee urged President Reagan to reverse his opposition to export subsidies to the Soviet Union as a way to get its negotiators to purchase some 500 mln dlrs in American wheat.

argentina-brazil trade jumped 90 pct in 1986,trade grain wheat,"Trade between Argentina and Brazil jumped 90 pct in 1986 versus 1985, Foreign Minister Dante Caputo said. Speaking to reporters, Caputo said the near doubling in trade showed the ""tangible and immediate results"" of a wide- ranging economic integration accord signed by the presidents of both countries last July. He said trade last year totalled 1.3 billion dlrs versus 700 mln dlrs in 1985. The accord provided for capital goods trade between the two countries to rise to 2.0 billion dlrs over four years. Argentine wheat exports to Brazil will increase from 1,375,000 tonnes in 1987 to 2.0 mln tonnes in 1991, the accord said."
west german fishmeal imports highest in 15 years,fishmeal meal-feed,"West German gross fishmeal imports rose 60,260 tonnes, or 14.6 pct, last year to 471,891 tonnes, the highest level since 1972, trade sources said. Re-exports fell by 6.6 pct, resulting in a surge in net imports from 175,901 to 251,708 tonnes, an increase of 43 pct. Total West German consumption was estimated at around a high 287,000 tonnes, largely reflecting attractive prices. The sources, however, could not give comparative figures for 1985. South American producer countries supplied 97 pct of West German requirements, with Chile shipping 229,176 tonnes (1985 - 182,959) and Peru 210,513 (147,014) tonnes. The two South American countries' share of the West German market rose to 93.2 pct from 80.2 pct because imports from Ecuador fell to 21,110 tonnes in 1986 from 51,722 in 1985.

The amount will be set at tender on Monday March 9 between 0800 and 0830 GMT. The new facility will replace the current 4.8 billion guilders of seven-day advances expiring Monday. Money dealers estimated today's money market shortage at 11 to 11.25 billion guilders, barely changed from yesterday. They said call money was still relatively high at 6-1/8 to 6-1/4 pct as a result of the tight set of bids accepted by the Bank for the previous seven-day facility."
canada upholds countervail duty on u.s. corn,grain corn,The Canadian Import Tribunal ruled today subsidized U.S. corn imports were injurious to Canadian growers and upheld a countervailing duty of 84.9 U.S. cts a bushel set earlier this year. The ruling is the result of trade action launched in 1985 by the Ontario Corn Producers Association that contended U.S. subsidies were driving American corn prices below Canadian production costs. A spokesman for the Department of Revenue said a study of the level of the duty will be undertaken in the next six months to determine if it should be adjusted.
february u.s. jobs gains show stronger economy,jobs ipi gnp income trade retail,"Momentum in th U.S. economy may be picking up given solid across-the board increases in the February U.S. employment report, economists said. U.S. non-farm payroll employment rose 337,000 in February, twice what the financial markets expected. This follows a 319,000 gain in January, revised down from a previously reported 448,000 increase. ""Even if you look at January and February together, this is still a much stronger report than the consensus expectation in the market,"" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation. Economists stressed that gains in hours worked signal much larger gains in February U.S. production and income than previously forecast. The average work week rose 0.2 hours to 35.0 hours from 34.8 hours in January. The average manufacturing work week rose 0.3 hours to 41.2 hours, the longest factory work week since November 1966, the Commerce Department said. ""The gains in manufacturing employment point to a very large increase in industrial production of between 0.5 and 0.7 pct,"" said Joe Carson of Chemical Bank. This compares to a 0.4 pct gain in January U.S. industrial production. Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co Inc noted that the average wage rate increased to 8.87 dlrs an hour in February from 8.83 dlrs in January. ""Combined with the increase in hours worked, this means we'll get a pretty healthy gain in personal income vis-a-vis the wage and salary disbursement,"" he said. Greenbaum said that February U.S. personal income should rise at least 0.5 pct after being flat in January. He said the February employment gains are consistent with his firm's first quarter U.S. real gross national product growth forecast of 3.7 pct. Economists agreed that the employment data were negative for the credit markets in that they signal a healthier economy and no easing in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. But most said that the market need not fear tighter policy either. ""This report is another reason for the Fed to not consider easing,"" said Ray Stone of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. ""It gives them more room to address the dollar situation,"" he said. ""If they had to nudge policy tighter, they could do so, but it's most likely they'll sit and wait."" ""The data have not been uniform,"" Stone added. ""Durable goods were weak in January and now employment is strong."" In January, U.S. durable goods orders dropped 7.5 pct, followed by a 4.0 pct drop in U.S. factory goods orders. U.S. retail sales fell 5.8 pct, and the U.S. merchandise trade gap widened to 14.8 billion dlrs. ""Things just aren't adding up,"" said Steve Slifer of Lehman Goverment Securities Inc. ""Consumer spending, capital spending, goverment spending, and net exports data show very weak first quarter GNP growth of one pct,"" he said. ""The employment and production data point to a big inventory build-up, but that's what we thought in the fourth quarter and we only got 1.3 pct GNP growth."" Manufacturing employment gained 50,000 after falling 15,000 in January. Economists estimated that 30,000 of the gain was accounted for by striking workers in the steel and machinery industries returning to work. Even so, some economists said that the manufacturing gains have resulted from an improving trade outlook. Jason Benderly of Goldman, Sachs and Co noted that the U.S. trade picture improved in the fourth quarter as net exports grew at a 20 pct annual rate while the rate of increase in imports fell to only six pct, and that it continues to improve in the first quarter. ""Not only the official statistics for the fourth quarter, but evidence of a pick up in orders from overseas for paper products, chemicals, high-tech goods, and capital goods show that trade is improving,"" Benderley said. ""The economy is moving between extremes,"" he said. ""Some reports are going to look bad and some good, but first quarter GNP is going to grow in the middle at about three pct."" A 287,000 gain in services employment comprised the greater part of February's employment gain. Retail services employment rose 129,000 in February, compared to a gain of 117,000 in January, previously reported at 166,000. Construction employment rose a slim 2,000 in February. But this follows a robust 113,000 gain in January, revised down from a previously reported 142,000 gain. The U.S. civilian unemployment rate was unchanged in February at 6.7 pct. This means the jobless rate has stayed at 6.7 pct for three consecutive months, the lowest reading since March 1980, the Commerce Department noted. ""The Federal Reserve has to be pleased with this report,"" Carson said. ""This takes away the Fed's flexibility to ease, but there's no reason to tighten. It's way too early for that."""

Baker, when asked if the policy was changed in view of comments yesterday by a senior Commerce Department official who said he thought the Japanese yen was undervalued against the dollar by 10 to 15 pct, replied, ""No."" Yesterday Robert Ortner, Undersecretary of Commerce for Economic Affairs, said he thought the yen was undervalued but said that was his personal view. This remark caused the dollar to drop as it appeared to conflict with a recent agreement in Paris by the United States and five other industrial nations that currency rates were at about the right level to reflect underlying economic conditions. Baker, who spoke earlier to the National Newspaper Association, declined to elaborate on his statement about U.S. policy."

german cash in circulation up at february's close,money-supply reserves,"Cash in circulation in West Germany rose by 2.8 billion marks in the last week of February to 121.5 billion, a gain of 8.3 pct over the same month last year, the Bundesbank said. Cash in circulation is one of two components of the West German money supply which the German central bank is targeting to grow between three and six pct this year. Gross currency reserves in the week rose by 200 mln marks to 109.5 billion. Foreign liabilities fell 100 mln to 22.9 billion, giving a net currency reserves increase of 300 mln to 86.6 billion. Commercial bank minimum reserve holdings at the Bundesbank fell 300 mln marks to 51.9 billion marks at the end of February, averaging 51.2 billion over the month. The rediscount debt of the banking system fell 800 mln marks to 55.2 billion marks, the Bundesbank said. Banks made heavy use of the Lombard emergency funding facility to meet month-end payments and borrowed 3.1 billion marks, a rise of 2.9 billion over the week before. The net position of public authorities at the Bundesbank declined 6.7 billion marks in the last week of February. The federal government drew down 3.8 billion marks of its Bundesbank cash deposits, which had stood at 4.1 billion in the third week of February, and also borrowed a 1.8 billion in credit from the central bank. Federal states' deposits fell 1.5 billion marks to 1.3 billion and their cash credits dropped 400 mln to 300 mln. The Bundesbank balance sheet total rose around 5.44 billion to 222.22 billion marks."
french primary bond market shows new sparkle,interest money-fx,"The French primary bond market is showing signs of renewed effervescence after several weeks of lethargy and the trend is expected to continue if hopes of imminent interest rate cuts are fulfilled, market operators said. The Bank of France is generally expected to give a signal to the market, possibly at the beginning of next week, by announcing a quarter point cut in its intervention rate, which has stood at eight pct since January 2, or in its seven-day repurchase rate, set at 8-3/4 pct since January 5. The central bank's averaged-out day to day call money rate, the reference rate for interbank money market operators, which reached 8-3/4 pct on February 18 has fallen to 7-3/4 pct this week, dealers noted. The Bank of France's ""open market"" policy to regulate the money markets since December has been based on a floor and ceiling of rates within the limits of its intervention and seven day repurchase rates. For the moment the sentiment is of ""wait and see"" on rate cuts, but there are now more optimists than pessimists among market operators, a dealer for a major French bank said. Dealers said there is abundant liquidity on the bond market, noting that this week's monthly Treasury tap issue of 11.87 billion francs had a good reception and was fairly easily absorbed. The Treasury had set an upper limit on the issue of 12 billion francs and was likely to continue to try and sell as much paper as it could over coming months to meet its borrowing needs for this year of around 150 billion, one banker said. Dealers said there was no difficulty in placing liquidity in the primary market at the moment despite competition from the surge in investments on the Paris stock exchange. There has been a flood of large bond issues, but with formulas well adapted to market conditions and investor demand - with warrants or a mix of fixed and floating-rates - which have been snapped up, and with generally broadly negative fees. Dealers pointed to the recent Caisse d'Aide a l'Equipement des Collectivites Locales (CAECL) 8.90 pct two billion franc bond with warrants exchangeable for floating-rate bonds issued over 13 years and 80 days at 97.04 pct with payment date March 9, which was today quoted at -0.90 to -1.10 pct. Even classic fixed-rate issues, after being neglected since the end of last year, are finding buyers, one banker said. Dealers said that now the question was to see how the terms of imminent operations would be set, with great market interest focussed on the likely three next issues. These will include an expected four to five billion franc issue for Electricite de France, to be followed by a bond of around one billion francs for Auxiliaire du Credit Foncier, a subsidiary of the banking group Credit Foncier de France, and a new issue by tender from the mortgage agency Caisse de Refinancement Hypothecaire."
imf urges belgium to make further spending cuts,interest gnp,"The Belgian government, which introduced large-scale public spending reductions last year, has been told by an International Monetary Fund team there is scope for further cuts in 1988. The suggestion is contained in the preliminary conclusions of the annual IMF consultations with Belgium on its economic policy, a copy of which was distributed to journalists at the weekly press conference following meetings of the cabinet. The IMF team also urges Belgium to adopt a firm interest rate policy, with a particular emphasis on long-term rates. The team's report to the government praises last year's spending cuts, which are due to reduce 1987 government spending by 195 billion francs, and says 1986 saw the Belgian economy perform ""better, on a broader basis, than at any time so far in the 1980s."" However, it adds that with lower inflation, stabilisation of the debt to gross national product ratio requires a much lower budget deficit than the seven pct of GNP target the government has set itself for 1989. The government's net financing requirement was 11.0 pct of GNP in 1986. The report says ""The most that can be afforded over the next few years is a zero growth of real non-interest expenditure of general Government."" It says there is a need for a revision of the Belgian tax system to iron out distortions and meet hopes of a reduced tax burden but substantial progress is needed in stabilising the debt to GNP ratio before this is possible. ""Because of the difficulty of sustaining zero expenditure growth and of likely growing impatience (for) tax reductions, we feel that your position would be stronger if you could decide on rather sharp expenditure reductions in 1988,"" the report adds. The IMF urges a strong interest rate policy to signal the government's determination to keep its currency strong and to curb inflation. It says firmer long-term rates would slow private net long-term capital outflows, which increased strongly in 1986. It also urges net repayments of foreign currency debt and an overhaul of domestic capital markets to facilitate the subscriptions by non-residents of government bond issues in Belgian francs."
lyng disappointed by canada corn injury decision,grain corn,"U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said he is ""very disappointed"" by a Canadian government finding that U.S. corn has injured Ontario Corn growers. ""This action is not helpful in the context of the ongoing U.S.-Canada free trade talks or in the new round of multilateral trade negotiations,"" Lyng said in a statement. The Canadian government today said Ottawa would continue to apply a duty of 84.9 cents per bushel on U.S. corn imports. Lyng said the U.S. made a case that U.S. corn imports are not the cause of any problem of Canadian corn producers, adding that U.S. corn exports to Canada are declining. ""Apparently they (Canada) have ignored the fact that Canadian corn and other coarse grain production is rising faster than consumption,"" Lyng said."

In a letter to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, NAWG stated its ""strong support"" for an eep offer to Moscow. ""We believe that a solid case continues to exist for Soviet EEP eligibility, and the recently announced and reported Soviet purchases of U.S. corn indicate a Soviet willingness to purchase U.S. grain if it is competitively priced,"" NAWG said. ""Consequently, we believe it is important to renew the U.S. eep offer and do all that is reasonably possible to ensure mutual adherence to the terms of the U.S.-Soviet grain agreement,"" the letter said."

""We'd need some assurances from them (the Soviets) that they would buy if offered"" the wheat under the subsidy plan, he said. Kay called reports that such an offer was imminent ""premature."" The Reagan administration's cabinet-level Economic Policy Council is set to meet today to discuss, among other matters, agricultural policy but is not expected to address a wheat subsidy offer to the Soviet Union, administration officials said earlier."

""U.S. corn exports to Canada are so small that it is inconceivable that they injure Canadian corn farmers by any reasonable measure,"" Yeutter said in a statement. He said if other countries follow Canada's lead it could result in ""a rash of protectionist actions throughout the world."" French corn growers have recently indicated they will challenge U.S. corn gluten feed shipments to Europe. Yeutter said the U.S. will examine the Canadian decision closely and if the U.S. believes the decision was not based on facts, ""will carefully evaluate appropriate responses."" Yeutter did not say what steps the U.S. may take in response."
mge planning april 6 start up of hfcs contract,sugar corn grain,"The Minneapolis Grain Exchange (MGE) will start trading futures contracts in high fructose corn syrup on April 6 if the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approves the contract as expected next week. Pat Henderson, spokesperson for the MGE, said the exchange expects contract approval at CFTC's Tuesday meeting. It has been under review since the exchange submitted the proposal in December, 1985. The proposed contract is based on 48,000 pound lots of 55-pct high fructose corn syrup, the equivalent of one tank truck of the sweetening agent derived from corn in the wet milling process. The syrup, commonly called HFCS-55, is most commonly used as a sweetener in soft drinks and other beverages. Delivery would be by shipping certificate from production facilities designated by the exchange. The contract, designated by the symbol ""HF,"" would trade from 0900 to 1315 CST. Months traded would correspond with the Chicago corn futures months of March, May, July, September and December. Contract price will be quoted per hundred weight, with a minimum price fluctuation of one cent and maximum fluctuation of one dlr per CWT. ""We hope the producers and users of fructose will be actively involved, those producers being the large processors, the corn wet millers, and the users being the beverage bottlers,"" Henderson said. ""But there are potentials for all types of people to use it. There is quite a list of industries that utilize fructose."""

brazil strikes cause government major problems,ship gas,"Strikes by Brazil's 40,000 seamen and by petrol station owners in four states are causing major headaches to a government already wrestling with a debt crisis. A week ago seamen began their first national strike for 25 years and union leaders say they have seriously affected Brazilian exports by making idle 160 ships. On February 20 the Brazilian government suspended interest payments on part of its huge foreign debt following a sharp deterioration in its trade balance. Today the government faced a fresh problem, when most petrol station owners in Sao Paulo, the country's industrial heartland, and in three other states closed down to press for higher fuel prices. There were fears that the combination of the two stoppages could lead to a serious fuel shortage. The seamen's leaders say their strike has halted 48 of the 72 ships belonging to the state oil company Petrobras. The Jornal do Brasil newspaper, in an editorial today entitled ""Dangerous Confrontation,"" said: ""From the economic point of view the seamen's strike carries an alarming cost, with grave consequences for the supply situation and for the country's external trade."" The seamen are seeking a 275 pct pay rise and have rejected offers of up to 100 pct. Later today the Higher Labour Tribunal in Brasilia is due to rule on whether the seamen's strike is legal. But a senior official of the National Merchant Marine Union, Jorge Luis Leao Franco, told Reuters that the strike would continue regardless of the tribunal's ruling. Labour unrest has worsened in Brazil following the collapse over the last few months of the government's Cruzado Plan price freeze. Prices have been rising at about 15 pct a month. Not only workers but also businessmen are restive. Petrol station owners said many garages had closed indefinitely today in Sao Paulo, Parana, Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul. Television reports said that in the Parana state capital of Curitiba petrol stations were only supplying fuel for exceptional cases such as ambulances and funeral processions. Brazilian garage owners want to be allowed to raise their profits on alcohol fuel and petrol sales to 1.26 cruzados (six U.S. Cents) a litre from 0.56 cruzados (about 2.5 cents). Queues formed at petrol stations in Sao Paulo late last night as motorists filled up their tanks while they still could. Political sources said the government of President Jose Sarney was closely following the strikes and the overall fuel supply situation."
u.s. feedgrains group attacks canada corn ruling,grain corn,"The U.S. Feedgrains Council is surprised and disappointed by the Canadian Import Tribunal's decision that imports of corn from the U.S. are materially injuring Canadian corn producers, a council spokesman said. ""At a time when the world is attempting to liberalize trade in the new rounnd of multilateral negotiations, it is incomprehensible that a country that stands to gain so much from the reduction in agricultural trade barriers would threaten that process by caving in to pressures for protectionism,"" council president Darwin E. Stolte said. Canada's finding will strain the U.S./Canadian trading relationship, could damage the future of U.S. feedgrains support for the free trade negotiations, and also negatively impact farm trade reform with other nations, the council said."
lyng says no decisions taken at cabinet council,grain wheat,"U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said no decisions were taken today at a White House Economic Policy Council meeting. Speaking to reporters on his return from the meeting, Lyng said only about five minutes of the session dealt with agriculture issues. ""It was not a decision making meeting,"" Lyng said. Aides to Lyng earlier said the administration's agriculture legislative proposals would be the farm-related topic on the agenda. Lyng would not comment on what farm issues were discussed. Asked how he would respond to farm groups and Congressmen urging the U.S. to offer a wheat bonus to the Soviet Union, Lyng said he would be listen but be ""non-committal."""
u.s. feedgrain 0/92 supporters evaluate position,grain wheat,"Advocates of a 0/92 plan for feedgrains will likely delay offering their proposals if a disaster aid bill before the House Agriculture Committee is scaled back to include only 1987 winter wheat, congressional sources said. The disaster aid bill, introduced by Rep. Glenn English (D-Okla.), sparked sharp controversy with its proposals to implement a 0/92 program for 1987 wheat and 1988 winter wheat. An agreement has been reached to trim the bill back to 1987 wheat, but supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains plan said even that scaled-down version would not be equitable for farmers. Unless the English bill pertains only to 1987 winter wheat, it is more than a simple disaster payment and feedgrains should be treated equally, they said. If the bill is narrowed to just winter wheat, then supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains amendment will probably not offer their proposals next week, sources said. English has agreed to support an amendment by Rep. Charles Stenholm (R-Tex) to narrow the bill to 1987 wheat only, but whether he would also back a further reduction is unclear. Agricultural aides to English said the congressman's first choice is to make the option available to all 1987 wheat farmers. However, if the political reality is that disaster aid for winter wheat farmers would be unavailable because of controversy over spring wheat, then English might consider an even greater cutback in the bill, they said. Under a 0/92 plan, farmers could forego planting and still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments. Rep. Arlan Stangeland (R-Minn.) and Harold Volkmer (D-Mo.) have both expressed interest in expanding the English bill to include a 0/92 program for feedgrains. An aide said Stangeland does not want to reopen the farm bill, but to be fair to all crops. Only a small percentage of spring wheat farmers would likely sign up for 0/92 since the incentives to plant are greater than to idle the land, economists said. Opponents to a 0/92 feedgrains program argue it is premature to make major changes in the farm bill and that the House Agriculture Committee needs to study more closely the impacts of such a program."

u.s. corn growers blast canada corn ruling,grain corn cornglutenfeed meal-feed,"Canada's ruling in favor of a duty on U.S. corn was a keen disappointment to the National Corn Growers Association and has set a dangerous precedent for other nations to follow, said Mike Hall, lobbyist for the association. ""The French corn growers will clearly charge ahead now and just change corn to corn gluten feed"" in their complaint, Hall told Reuters. A Canadian government agency ruled today that U.S. farm policies are causing injury to Canadian corn farrmers and supported an earlier imposed countervailing duty of about 85 cts per bushel. ""This was cleary a political decision,"" Hall said. ""The amount of corn we export to Canada is insignificant."" The unexpected ruling appeared to be based on the agrument that Canada bases its corn prices on U.S. futures prices and that American farm policy has driven down these prices, thus causing lower prices to Canadian farmers and larger government payments through its farm stabilization program, Hall said. Hall said this is a new definition for injury, but that other nations might also now apply this same argument to attack U.S. farm programs. The French corn growers could now charge that U.S. farm programs create an unfair subsidy for corn gluten feed, Hall said. The French have long wanted to control the imports of U.S. corn gluten feed into the community, saying that the imported feed was unfairly displacing European grain."
u.s. farm programs help canadian corn producers,grain corn,"An American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) official said that far from hurting Canadian corn producers, U.S. farm programs benefit all foreign producers. AFBF president Dean Kleckner made the comments in response to the ruling earlier today by the Canadian Import Tribunal that subsidized U.S. corn imports were injurious to Canadian growers. The tribunal upheld a countervailing duty of 84.9 U.S. cents a bushel. ""Farm Bureau specialists went to Ottawa and testified previous U.S. farm programs have actually benefited all foreign producers by reducing the amount of corn grown in the U.S. (and losing market share), while exerting an upward influence on the price of corn Worldwide,"" he said."
positive outlook tempered in u.s. debt futures,interest crude,"Higher oil prices and stronger than expected U.S. employment growth led to sharp losses in U.S. interest rate futures and diminished what had been a positive chart outlook, financial analysts said. The increase of 319,000 in non-farm payroll employment during February was above market expectations for a rise of 170,000 to 200,000 jobs and sparked selling in Treasury bond futures that drove the June contract through key technical support at 101-2/32 at the opening Friday, they noted. ""I don't like that fact that we had a close below 101,"" said Prudential Bache analyst Fred Leiner. The 101-2/32 level in the June bond contract had been the top of a three-month trading range, which when penetrated during the rally Wednesday led to bullish forecasts by chartists. But analysts called it a false breakout on the weekly charts when the June bond closed at 100-10/32 Friday. Some also forecast that the high of the week at 101-19/32 may signal a bearish double top formation portending steep losses. ""I tend to go along with the double top scenario,"" said Northern Futures analyst Eileen Rico. Rico noted that the possible formation, along with the fact that the rally of the last two weeks in bond futures has occurred on relatively low volume, were negative signals. Despite what could be a negative chart outlook, Leiner remains cautiously optimistic, and June bonds should find support between 100 and 99-16/32 next week. The optimistic outlook, as well as Leiner's expectation that the yield curve will flatten in the near term, is based on an improving inflation outlook. With the dollar stable and economic data giving the Federal Reserve little room to ease monetary policy, ""the inflation outlook is improving,"" Leiner said, and that should lead to relatively stronger bond prices than bill and Eurodollar prices. Still, Leiner noted that the recent rise in oil prices remains a concern for the inflation outlook. Oil rose during the week on reports that OPEC nations were maintaining production quotas and official prices, and got an extra boost Friday due to the suspension of oil exports from Ecuador after an earthquake Thursday. ""The runup in crude oil will be a short-lived phenomenon,"" said Carroll McEntee and McGinley analyst Brian Singer. The rise in oil prices over the past week has been largely ""media induced,"" Singer said. He noted that even though OPEC production may be within quotas, ""oil stocks are at tremendously high levels."" Although the Ecuador situation could cause a delay, oil prices will eventually decline to the lows of late February, he said, and that will be a supportive influence for bond prices."
argentina unaffected by brazil's maize decision,grain corn,"A government official said that a decision by Brazil not to import maize because it forecast a record harvest would not affect Argentina's exports. ""We have heard nothing about this, but if Brazil has decided not to import maize that is no problem for us as it is not one of our main customers,"" Agriculture, Livestock and Fisheries Under-Secretary Miguel Braceras said. Private sources also said Argentina's exports would not be affected by Brazil's decision, which Agriculture Minister Iris Resende announced yesterday in Sao Paulo. Brazil had not asked for any Argentine maize, they said. They also said a smaller crop and adverse weather this summer in Argentina had reduced production. Braceras said that last year Brazil bought 800,000 tonnes of Argentine maize but in some years it had not imported any from Argentina. The Soviet Union was Argentina's main customer and Japan was also becoming a bigger importer of the country's maize, he said."
ecuador adopts austerity measures after quake,crude fuel jet,"OPEC member Ecuador adopted austerity measures to conserve fuel after oil production was paralyzed by a strong earthquake. Energy and Mines Minister Javier Espinosa announced on television the country would cut domestic fuel sales by 30 pct. A ministry statement had earlier announced indefinite suspension of crude oil exports, declaring force majeure. Deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite told a television interviewer that it could possibly take more than a month to repair Ecuador's main pipeline linking Amazon basin oil fields to the Pacific Ocean coast. The quake on Thursday, which registered six on the 12-point Mercalli scale, killed at least six people and was centred near the Reventador volcano about 90 km (50 miles) east of Quito. Ecuador had recently been pumping 260,000 barrels per day. The government's austerity measures ban the sale of aviation fuel to foreign airliners on international routes and no fuel will be available for ships owned by foreign lines. Ecuador also banned the sale of petrol on weekends and holidays and limited sales on weekdays, an Energy and Mines Ministry communique said."

ec farm liberalisation seen hurting thai tapioca,tapioca meal-feed,"Any European Community decision to liberalise farm trade policy would hurt Thailand's tapioca industry, said Ammar Siamwalla, an agro-economist at the Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI). He told a weekend trade seminar here that any EC move to cut tariff protection for EC grains would make many crops more competitive than tapioca in the European market. The EC is the largest buyer of Thai tapioca, absorbing more than two thirds of the 5.8 mln tonnes of pellets exported by Thailand last year. Thailand has an EC quota of an average 5.25 mln tonnes a year until 1990. Ammar said Thailand had benefited from an EC tariff loophole that subjects Thai tapioca to a preferential six pct import duty. Ammar, head of the agricultural research group of the TDRI, suggested tapioca farmers diversify to other crops. He said: ""If cereal prices in Europe fall so that they are close to world prices, the tapioca market there will disappear completely."" He said the issue may put Thailand in a dilemma because it had recently joined other major commodity producers in calling on the EC to cut its farm product export subsidies."
china raises crop prices to increase output,cotton sugar veg-oil grain,"China has raised the prices it pays farmers for cotton, edible oil, sugar cane and beets to reverse a decline in output in 1986, He Kang, Minister of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries said. The China Daily quoted He as saying China should adopt intensive farming to increase per hectare output and improve crop quality and maintain arable land at 111 mln hectares. He gave no details of the price increases. On grain, He said the state will cut the quota it purchases from farmers by 50 mln tonnes and abolish the practice of purchasing through agents. He said the state will increase investment in agriculture and supplies of fertiliser, diesel oil and other production materials and stabilise fertiliser and diesel oil prices. The state offers cheap fertiliser and diesel oil and payment in advance to farmers who contract to supply grain at a low state-fixed price. He said China aims to produce between 425 and 450 mln tonnes of grain by 1990, up from a target of 405 mln this year and an actual 391 mln last year. He gave no more details."

"oecd trade, growth seen slowing in 1987",trade gnp bop dlr,"The 24 nations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), hampered by sluggish industrial output and trade, face slower economic growth, and their joint balance of payments will swing into deficit in 1987, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU ) said. The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD economic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year, compared with a 2.8 pct growth forecast in December. It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the smaller European countries it influences, and Japan, hardest hit by currency appreciation this year. The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth rate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct in December and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan. It said it expected the OECD to post a current account deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due in large part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices. It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely to fall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in 1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986. It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlr payments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year. The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50 dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18 dlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes increasingly ragged. It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in foreign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on its trade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last year's 18.4 pct drop. The average mark/dollar rate is put at 1.80 marks this year and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate is expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said. ""This is not a crash scenario but the dollar's steeper angle of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball rather than a three-point landing,"" the EIU said. ""Talking will not stop the dollar's slide for long and the February meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to more expansive policies in West Germany and Japan, or a tighter U.S. Fsical policy,"" it said. It said the key to the dollar's fortunes was the willingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Government assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss. ""Thus far they have been willing,"" the EIC said, adding that if Japan was deterred from buying U.S. bonds the dollar would collapse. To contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rates would have to soar, bringing recession and a Third World debt crisis, it said. On trade, the EIU said prospects for 1987 look ""increasingly sick."" Import growth, forecast in December at 4.5 pct, is now seen slowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to 4.2 pct in 1988, it said. The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest single factor, with import growth there expected to feature a sluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast in December, the EIU said. On the export side, it said it saw weak demand in West Germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe, while Japan's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S. Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower, more competitively-priced dollar. It said in most of Europe and in Japan, raw materials and oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986."
poehl says further rate cut possible - sources,interest money-fx dlr,"Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl told a closed investment symposium that West Germany could cut leading interest rates again if the United States makes a similar move, banking sources said. The sources were reporting Poehl's remarks at a symposium in Duesseldorf last week organised by Deutsche Bank Ag. Press representatives were not invited. The sources, speaking separately, said Poehl told about 200 bankers in reply to questions that a cut in U.S. Interest rates would give room for a matching measure in Germany. ""It was a definite hint at lower German interest rates,"" said one banker who attended the symposium. A Bundesbank spokesman said the central bank would have no comment on the reported remarks, made at the private meeting. But, according to a second source, who also declined to be identified, Poehl's comments were seen by bankers present as a direct pointer to further moves by the central bank to defend German industry from an additional revaluation of the mark. ""He said if the Americans drop their interest rates then the Bundesbank would also drop them. He said that quite clearly,"" the second source said. In reply to questions, Poehl also said the half-point cut in the discount and Lombard rates on January 22 came after the U.S. Had signalled it would be prepared to attend a meeting to discuss the level of the dollar on condition Germany made such a move in advance, the sources said. Asked if American authorities could have been persuaded, by cuts in German rates, to come to the bargaining table as early as last September, one of the sources quoted Poehl as saying, ""No, they wouldn't have been. We checked that."" The Paris meeting of the Group of Six industrial nations took place exactly one month after the German cut in rates. Poehl emphasised in his comments the very close talks between central banks before and after the G-6 meeting, saying that financial markets had not fully realised the significance of the Paris session and the U.S. Agreement to stem further falls in the value of the dollar, the sources said. For the first time all participants at the summit agreed that a further fall in the dollar would be harmful for all world economies, including the U.S., Poehl had said. The sources said the tone of Poehl's comments boosted growing sentiment that the dollar would be stabilised around current levels by international central bank cooperation. One source said Poehl's remarks also underlined the fact that the Bundesbank was now more prepared to be accommodative in monetary policy in order to prevent a further slowdown in West Germany's economic growth. Poehl and other Bundesbank officials have in the past stressed that the German central bank had no direct responsibility for growth and was solely concerned with combatting inflation. This led, for instance, to the introduction of a tighter monetary stance from the beginning of December until the half-point cut in rates in late January. The sources quoted Poehl as saying that the current overshooting of the German monetary target would not directly respark inflation. The Bundesbank was not obliged to react immediately whenever such overshooting occurs. Latest data for central bank money stock, the Bundesbank's main measure of money supply, showed the measure was growing at 7-1/2 pct in January, outside its three to six pct 1987 target. Share prices rose in very active trading today, with dealers reporting that Poehl's remarks, coupled with a bullish outlook on stock prices from Deutsche at the same symposium, brought in strong bargain hunting at current low levels."
dutch planning agency forecasts lower growth,gnp jobs cpi bop dfl,"Dutch economic growth is slowing as a firming guilder cuts competitiveness abroad and industries reduce the pace of investment, the Dutch official planning agency CPB said. The Centraal Planbureau, publishing its 1987 economic outlook, said Dutch Net National Income (NNI) was expected to grow by one pct this year, down from two pct growth recorded in 1986 and 2.5 pct in 1985 and 1984. Dutch Gross National Product is expected to rise to 432.20 billion guilders in 1987 in constant prices, a two pct increase from last year's 423.95 billion. The CPB, forecasting an 8.5 pct increase in the value of the guilder on a trade-weighted basis compared with 10.0 pct last year, said the dollar was expected to trade at an average of 2.0 guilders in 1987 compared with 2.45 guilders in 1986. ""The higher guilder is causing a substantial fall in unit labour costs abroad, when measured in guilder terms, while these are rising slightly in the Netherlands,"" the CPB said. More of economic growth now depended on domestic consumption, the CPB said, but noting that higher margins set by domestic producers and importers mitigated the effect on purchasing power of lower import costs and deflation. Consumer prices were set to fall by 1.5 pct this year, the CPB said. Inflation was zero last year. Gross investment in industry was expected to grow by five pct this year, a slowdown compared with 11.5 pct growth last year, the CPB said. Exchange rate and oil price fluctuations will continue to condition the Dutch economy in the future as it has in recent years, the CPB said, noting a continued depressing impact of these factors on Dutch competitiveness. In addition, it noted a slight rise in taxation and social security costs to employers. The CPB, forecasting a rise in the budget deficit to 7.2 pct of Net National Income in 1987 from 6.3 pct last year, urged the government to cut expenditure further to bring down the deficit and reduce tax and social security payments in future. Dutch government revenue is being depressed further by falling income from natural gas sales in 1987, the CPB said. It said unemployment was expected to fall to 675,000 this year from 710,000 last year. While the two pct GDP growth forecast set by the CPB is within its latest forecast, issued last month, of 1.5 to two pct growth, the figure is well above recent market estimates. Dutch merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson said in its February economic outlook that GDP growth at constant prices was expected to be 1.1 pct this year and market analysts had expected the CPB's final forecast to be below its own latest estimate. ""It is too early to comment because I haven't seen the whole document yet, but it would seem we are more pessimistic in some of our estimates,"" a Pierson economist said. The CPB forecast 2.5 pct export growth in volume terms in 1987, after four pct growth last year. Excluding energy exports, the 1987 figure would be two pct, it said. Imports were set to rise by 4.5 pct this year compared with four pct in 1986 in volume terms, the CPB said. The balance of payments would see a sharp decline in the surplus, to six billion guilders in 1987 compared with 12.1 billion last year, the CPB forecast."
"bonn serious about currency pact, says tietmeyer",money-fx gnp,"West Germany takes ""very seriously"" the recent undertaking by major industrial countries to promote exchange rate stability around current levels, Finance Ministry State Secretary Hans Tietmeyer said. Talking to journalists before a meeting of European Community Economy and Finance Ministers here, Tietmeyer declined to say whether the February 22 Paris accord by the Group of Five countries plus Canada included secret agreements for stabilising currencies. But he noted the official communique said the participants agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange rates around current levels. ""We're taking this sentence very seriously,"" he said. Tietmeyer remarked that the dollar had hardly moved against the mark since the meeting. He said a slowdown in West German economic growth had been caused by sharp exchange rate swings and that the Paris agreement should help in this respect. Economics Ministry State Secretary Otto Schlecht said the Bonn government saw no current need for measures to bolster the economy but was paying close attention to the slower growth and had not ruled out ""appropriate and timely"" action if necessary. Schlecht and Tietmeyer were speaking ahead of a discussion by the EC ministers of the latest EC Commission report on the economic situation in the 12-nation bloc. The Commission has sharply revised down expected German gross national product growth this year to two pct from 3.2 pct predicted last autumn and says Bonn has the most room of any EC country to stimulate economic activity. Schlecht said the upturn in West Germany's economy slowed in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of 1987. But he said there was no cumulative downwards trend in view that would make quick remedial action necessary. He said a number of favourable indicators such as high level of investment and a good climate for consumption meant a recovery could be expected, while exports would pick up slightly during the course of the year."

No timetable was given. Members of the three exchanges have been consulted, Agricultural Futures Exchange secretary Bill Englebright told Reuters, and no objections have been raised to the merger. Three markets are involved at present but the new exchange could ultimately combine five markets. Discussions are taking place with the Baltic International Freight Futures Exchange, BIFFEX, and the GAFTA London Grain Futures Market is considering the possibility of joining the other markets, market officials said. The BIFFEX board is expected to reach a decision on the merger at its meeting at the end of this month, after members are consulted at a meeting on March 16. The grain futures market also intends to consult its members soon, GAFTA director general James Mackie said. The aim of the amalgamation is to limit regulatory and administrative costs and achieve the recognition required under the 1986 Financial Services Act. This legislation requires a futures market to become a Recognised Investment Exchange, RIE, for trading to continue. Representatives of all the futures markets on the Baltic Exchange have been discussing the possibility of a single RIE structure since the beginning of the year. The new exchange now planned will apply to the Securities and Investments Board for recognition as an RIE ""at the appropriate time,"" the Agricultural Futures Exchange said.

uk money rates fall as bank approves base rate cut,money-fx interest,"A half point cut in base lending rates was announced by the big four clearing banks today after the Bank of England finally endorsed such a move following weeks of downward pressure, dealers said. During its routine intervention in the market, the bank trimmed the rates at which it deals with the discount houses by half a point and National Westminster led the other clearing banks in reducing its base rate to 10-1/2 pct from 11 pct. The timing of the Bank of England move took operators by surprise after its recent action seemingly designed to dampen hopes of a base rate cut ahead of the U.K. Budget on March 17. For some time, fundamentals have led the market to push for a one point cut in base lending rates to 10 pct but the central bank has declined to follow wholesale money market rates down. Although political considerations -- the government's wish to see a fall in base rates coincide with the Budget -- had been suggested by operators last week as reasons for the Bank's delaying action, worries about the real strength of sterling and perhaps about the market's reaction to the content of the Budget may have been behind the central bank's caution, dealers said. In the event, sterling continued firm after the rate cut, leaving the market still looking for another half point fall.

It said it used about 20 mln dlrs of the proceeds to prepay principal on its senior secured notes. Semi-annual principal payments on the remaining 40 mln dlrs of notes have been satisfied until December 1988 as a result, it said. The company said the note agreements were amended to reflect an easing of some financial covenants, and an increase of interest to 13.5 pct from 13.0 pct until December 1990. It said the noteholders exercise price for 1,125,000 warrants was also reduced to 50 cts from 1.50 dlrs. The company said Energy Assets agreed to share the costs of increasing production at the Oak Hill field."

A glut of feed meals makes other oilseeds, such as soybeans, less desirable because they would add to already large meal stocks."
dart said likely supermarkets general suitor,acq earn,"Dart Group <DARTA> is likely seeking to buy Supermarkets General <SGL>, analysts said. ""There's been rumors that they've taken a position in the company, said Wood Gundie analyst Edward Comeau. Last year, Dart Group, owner of Auto Trak INc and Crown Books, competed against Kohlberg, Kravis to acquire Safeway Stores INc. The company later reached an accord under which it would buy 20 pct of the company after Kohlberg Kravis completed its leveraged buyout of the company. The company later sold its 20 pct stock for about 180 mln to 200 mln dlrs, according to analysts. Dart Group Corp was not immediately available for comment. Jerry Ballan, analyst with Conner Ballan division of Edward Viner and Co, said, ""They <Dart> has been rumored to be buying some other supermarkets as well, such as Stop and Shop."" ""My guess is that Supermarkets General does not want to be bought out,"" said Ballan. Analysts, however, said Supermarkets General is facing problems due to its Purity Supreme and Rickels operations, which might make it difficult to thwart a bid. Supermarkets General is expected to report about 1.70 dlrs a share compared to a 1.73 dlrs a share reported for 1985 on a post stock split basis. For the first quarter, Comeau predicts the company will earn 39 cts a share from 35 cts a share a year ago, and should earn about 2.05 dlrs for 1987. ""But that estimation could go to a 1.80 dlrs easily, due to Purity Supreme in New England,"" Comeau said. He said competition among supermarkets is getting heated in that area and that the company has had difficulty with integrating Purity Supreme with its Pathmark store operations. Rickels, a home center business, has faced problems due to the state of that industry, and has reported lower returns as an operating unit, according to analysts. Analysts said that if Dart buys Supermarkets General it would probably divest the company's operations. Analyst Comeau said ""supermarkets general may seek a combination with another supermarket co"
"fed watchers see u.s. economic, inflation upturn",gnp money-supply,"This year will see a pickup in U.S. economic growth and inflation, the Shadow Open Market Committee said in its semi-annual policy statement. The SOMC, a group of basically ""monetarist"" private economists, said that ""economic growth will accelerate in 1987 in response to powerful stimulative actions by the Federal Reserve."" The group said the Fed's actions have been excessive. As a result, it said that ""inflation and ultimately another recession now loom on the horizon."" The SOMC said that central bank policies that rely on progressively larger swings in monetary expansion will not lead to sustainable economic growth and stable prices. The group made no specific nominal forecasts of economic or inflation growth in its policy statement. However, the Committee at its Sunday policy-making meeting said it was basically in accord with projections by Jerry Jordan, who is a member of the SOMC and economist at First Interestate Bancorp. Jordan expects real GNP growth to be about one percentage point higher than in the past two years. He expects consumer prices to rise about 4-1/2 pct this year. The SOMC said in recent months rapid money growth has been a principal cause of the devaluation. To avoid another costly inflation and disinflation, the SOMC urged the Fed to ""abandon its inflationary policy and set the growth rate of the monetary base on the path toward sustained lower inflation."" The Fed in February said it would no longer target the narrow M-1 money supply because the link between M-1 and economic growth has been largely s"
usx <x> chairman calls for lower dollar,money-fx dlr trade acq,"USX Corp chairman David Roderick called for a lower value for the U.S. dollar against other currencies to help speed a correction in the U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 170 billion dlrs. In remarks prepared for a speech before the Economic Club of Detroit, Roderick said, ""There should be total resolve that the dollar versus other major currencies, as well as the currencies of other nations having a substantial trade surplus with us, must continue to decline so that the correction in our trade deficit starts on the road to recovery."" Roderick said the U.S. should be understanding of the ""economic pain"" our trading partners experience as a result of a falling dollar. But, he added, ""As painful as the correction may be to our trading partners, it is less painful than leaving the problem uncorrected because that would lead us into an inevitable, lengthy and steep world recession."" Roderick said between February 1985 and December 1986 the dollar fell by more than 40 pct in real terms against major industrial currencies and by 30 to 35 pct against a broader group of currencies of nearly all developing nations. At the end of 1986, he said, the value of foreign assets in the U.S. exceeded the value of U.S. assets abroad by 240 billion dlrs, compared to five years ago when the U.S. had a surplus in assets of 141 billion. A company spokesman said the data were provided by economic consultants to USX. The primary reason for the trade imbalance was the 70 pct rise of the dollar between 1980 and 1985, although other factors were involved, Roderick said. But it is wrong, he said, ""to attribute the massive trade deficit to a fundmental deterioration of U.S. productivity or of American product quality."" These areas need to be improved but they are not the root cause of the trade gap problem, Roderick said. He urged American manufacturers to become more competitive so they can compete in global markets. In the speech, the USX chairman also called for changes in securities laws to curb what he called abuses by corporate raiders and speculators. Among his proposals, which he presented to the Senate Banking Committee in testimony last week, were a requirement that raiders give 24-hour notice for every one pct of stock they acquire in a company. Roderick proposed that tender offers must be made for all cash to all stockholders on equal terms and that raiders be required to have financing in place before a tender is made. Further, raiders should be required to make an all-cash tender offer once they acquire 10 pct of a target company's stock, he said. And payment of greenmail, or a preferential price by a target company to buy back a raider's stake, should be prohibited under the revised laws. Roderick said changes were necessary to curb abuses but that he did not want laws that would hurt the financial markets or discourage ""fair price to all"" takeovers."

lmfe to concentrate on cash settled contracts,hog l-cattle livestock,"The London Meat Futures Exchange, LMFE, will cease trading in its deliverable pigmeat contract from April 3, the LMFE said. The move will enable the exchange to concentrate on the cash settled contracts introduced last year. ""This allows the exchange and its members to concentrate our marketing on the pig and live cattle contracts,"" LMFE official Peter Freeman said. ""These two have already shown their effectiveness for hedging, and the trade in both contracts is increasing,"" he added. ""Using the futures market allows better planning and forward price fixing that our industry needs,"" chairman Pat Elmer said. Some 131 pig contracts were settled against the Meat and Livestock Commission's Average All Pigs Price in February, which represents hedging for over 13,000 pigs, more than twice the number cash-settled in January, the LMFE said. Cash settlement on the new cattle and pig contracts was introduced last June in the expectation that the appeal of the futures market to farmers, abattoirs and users of meat would increase because of the absence of a delivery requirement."

Wheat guesses ranged from 13 mln to 18 mln bushels, compared with 14.1 mln bushels a week ago and 17.9 mln a year ago."
primary eurosterling market booms despite rate cut,interest stg,"Two new eurosterling bonds were launched today, making a total of 10 new deals in the sector so far this month, as borrowers rush to cash in on a bull sterling market fueled by the strength of the pound and pre-budget euphoria. The Bank of England finally gave way to a 1/2 point cut in banks' base lending rates earlier today, but dealers said this had been largely discounted and was not likely to detract from the current popularity of sterling-denominated investments. ""Sterling, in any shape or form, is flavor of the month and we're set to see many more eurosterling deals,"" one dealer said. Today's new eurosterling bonds were a 10-year, 100 mln stg deal for Sweden at 9-1/2 pct and priced at 101-1/4 pct, lead by Baring Brothers and Co Ltd and a 14 year 60 mln stg convertible deal for Storehouse Plc launched by SBCI International Ltd. ""We thought we saw a proverbial flood of new deals with the 14 we had last month but it seems March will beat February hands down with 10 already,"" one eurosterling specialist said. ""Optically, psychologically, these single figures are much more attractive for the borrower. Eurosterling looks like a cheap and attractive way to raise your money,"" he added. This accounts for the wide variety of borrowers who have tapped the sector recently, ranging from sovereigns such as the Kingdom of Sweden today, continental banks including Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank and British corporations. Another U.K. Merchant bank analyst noted that the current vogue for eurosterling enabled several corporate borrowers last month to offer paper priced below comparative gilt yields. A Storehouse official confirmed that the issue was aimed at Swiss and German investors who were showing good interest. This is the first entry into the long term international capital markets by Storehouse, British designer Terence Conran's retail conglomerate which incorporates U.K. Chain stores Mothercare, British Home Stores and Habitat. ""We have been considering the move for quite some time now and the current strength of the eurosterling sector provided the perfect opportunity and spur for us to finally tap the market,"" Lance Moir, corporate treasurer at Storehouse Plc told R"
central bankers satisfied with paris accord,money-fx interest,"Central bankers said they were generally satisfied with the response to the Paris accord two weeks ago to stabilize currencies at around current levels. Speaking after a meeting at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), which reviewed the agreement, they also welcomed interest rates cuts in France and today's drop in British rates. One top official said the rate cuts would help to stimulate growth generally in Europe and welcomed that countries other than West Germany were seen to be helping sustain the economy. The central bankers, who spoke on the condition they not be named, said the meeting of governors from the Group of 10 countries also heard a report from Michel Camdessus, the new managing director of the International Monetary Fund, on the IMF's latest assessment of the debt crisis. In particular, they discussed Brazil's debt moratorium. But there was no sense of urgency, they said, and Brazil had made no appeal for bridging loans from the BIS or central banks."
final 50/50 corn certs seen at 1.6 billion dlrs,grain corn,"The Agriculture Department will have to release an estimated 1.6 billion dlrs worth of in-kind certificates, or certs, to corn farmers this fall if USDA decides to maintain an equal split of total 1986 feedgrain deficiency payments in cash and certs, USDA officials said. Final 1986 crop deficiency payments will be available to feed grain producers in October. Wheat deficiency payments for the 1986 crop, now complete, were made in a 50/50 cash-certificate split, and USDA officials have indicated they want to do the same for feedgrains. Over 3.2 billion dlrs of an estimated 6.0 billion in corn deficiency payments have already been announced, with 1.42 billion dlrs (43 pct) set in certificates. The final payment must be 1.6 billion dlrs in certs (57 pct) for a 50/50 split. However, the release this month of almost 600 mln dlrs of deficiency payments was equally divided in cash and certs, doing nothing to bring up the percentage of certs. Some USDA analysts said the payments reflected hesitation from the Office of Managament and Budget to allow another huge release of certs onto the market. Bills are pending in Congress to move up the final feedgrain deficiency payment to ""as soon as five months after harvest as possible,"" rather than the current year lag time. Neither Rep. Edward Madigan (R-Ill.) nor Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kans.), sponsors of the bills, have brought the legislation forward. Aides said timing will depend on budget discussions."

usda raises soviet grain import estimate,grain wheat corn,"The U.S. Agriculture Department increased its estimate of Soviet 1986/87 grain imports to 26 mln tonnes from last month's projection of 23 mln tonnes. In its monthly USSR Grain Situation and Outlook, USDA said the increase reflected the return of the Soviet Union to the U.S. corn market and continued purchases of both wheat and coarse grain from other major suppliers. USSR wheat imports were projected at 15 mln tonnes, up one mln from last month's estimate and 700,000 tonnes below the preliminary 1985/86 figure. Soviet grain for feed use was estimated at a record 129 mln tonnes. Record or near-record livestock inventories, along with a dry fall which likely reduced late season pasturage, and a cold winter have increased feed demand, USDA said. USSR meat and egg production in January rose only slightly from the previous January's level, while milk production increased by nearly six pct. Unusually cold weather in January and smaller increases in roughage supplies during 1986 than in 1985 kept livestock production from expanding as much as it did a year earlier, USDA said."

Production in 1985/86 is estimated at 24.95 mln tonnes, vs 24.95 mln last month. Canadian wheat exports in 1986/87 are forecast at 19.00 mln tonnes, vs 18.00 mln tonnes last month.

The Commission has already decided to accord rebates for the export of 500,000 tonnes of French maize, of which rebates for around 100,000 tonnes have been granted. The request will be made when export certificates have been granted for all the 500,000 tonnes, the AGPM said. The association said that the request would cover exports to all destinations, adding that the Soviet Union, which has important maize needs, is currently excluded from the list of destination countries for the 500,000 tonnes of French maize. The U.S. Agriculture Department has forecast Soviet maize imports for the 1986/87 campaign at 4.90 mln tonnes against 10.40 mln in 1985/86."
"u.s. payments gap to persist, ex-fed chief says",trade bop money-fx dlr,"The dollar will decline over the next two to three years, but this is unlikely to result in a complete reduction of the U.S. current account deficit, said Anthony Solomon, chairman of S.G. Warburg (USA) Inc and former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. In a presentation to the Japan Society, Solomon said without elaboration that he expects a ""significant decline in the dollar,"" within the next three years. ""The dollar will fall more, but the current account deficit will stop being reduced when it reaches its structural core,"" he said. Solomon described the structural core as about one-half of the current 150 billion dlr annual deficit. He cited several factors which will prevent an elimination of the deficit. For one thing, it is unlikely that there will be any new investment in those manufacturing industries that shrank when the dollar was at uncompetitive levels, he said. In addition, he said that the U.S. has an increased propensity to import in order to satisify consumer tastes. Solomon forecast inflation at 4.5 pct by year-end, but said it could be kept below five pct in the medium-term if oil prices are stable and commodity values remain low."

They said the market already has discounted higher Soviet imports, partly on news last month that the Soviet Union bought one mln tonnes of U.S. corn, and on rumors that the Reagan administration is pushing for authority to sell the Soviets U.S. wheat under the Export Enhancement Program. In its supply-demand report, the USDA raised its estimate for 1986/87 Soviet grain imports to 26 mln tonnes from 23 mln. ""That was business already done, for all practical purposes,"" said Drexel Burnham analyst Dale Gustafson, reflecting similar statements made by other analysts."
world bank report criticises peru economic plan,gnp cpi money-fx,"A confidential World Bank report on the Peruvian economy has said the government's strategy does not offer good prospects for medium and long-term growth and is likely to lead to an early renewal of inflationary pressure. The report, published today by the economic monthly, The Peru Report, said the success of president Alan Garcia's government in stimulating output last year to achieve a growth in gross domestic product of over eight pct ""represents gains in the short term at the expense of the long."" Government officials had no immediate comment on the report, which advised a reduction in the overall size of the public investment program and greater emphasis on the preservation of Peru's export potential. The report said that although the government had succeeded in cutting inflation from 250 pct a year in the first half of 1985 to under 70 pct, its stabilisation and reactivation program was encountering rising difficulties. ""An early renewal of inflationary pressures, linked to monetary expansion, exchange rate devaluation and an easing of price controls, appears not improbable,"" it added. The world bank report said the government's policies had reduced inflation and short-term increases in consumption at the apparent cost of price distortions, overvaluation of the currency, balance of payments disequilibrium, reserve losses, and sharply diminished creditworthiness. It said unless the government took action quickly to fix a competitive exchange rate and control the public sector deficit, ""the higher the probability will be that the government will eventually have to resort to drastic curtailment of domestic demand and either sharp devaluation or still further controls on imports in order to stem inflation and support the balance of payments."" It said the bank would place more emphasis on the preservation of peru's export potential, external links and overall economic efficiency. The government's incentive policies towards the mining and petroleum sectors, among its main traditional exports, suggested that it did not accord high priority to their economic viability, it added."
"u.s. intervened to aid dlr in january, fed says",money-fx dlr yen,"U.S. authorities intervened in the foreign exchange market to support the dollar on one occasion during the period between the start of November 1986 and the end of January, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said in a report. The Fed's quarterly review of foreign exchange operations said that the U.S. bought 50 mln dlrs through the sale of yen on January 28. This operation was coordinated with the Japanese monetary authorities and was funded equally by the Fed and the U.S. Treasury. The Fed's intervention was on the morning after president Reagan's State of the Union message and was ""in a manner consistent with the joint statement"" made by U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker and Japanese finance minister Kiichi Miyazawa after their January 21 consultations. At that meeting, the two reaffirmed their willingness to cooperate on exchange rate issues. The Fed's report did not say at what level the intervention occurred. But on January 28, the dollar closed at 151.50/60 yen after dipping as low as 150.40 yen earlier in the session. It had closed at 151.05/15 yen the previous day. The dollar had plumbed a post-World War II low of 149.98 yen on January 19 and reached a seven-year low of 1.7675 marks on January 28. It ended that day at 1.7820/30 marks. The Fed noted that, after trading steadily throughout November and the first half of December, the dollar moved sharply lower until the end of January. It closed the three-month review period down more than 11 pct against the mark and most other Continental currencies and seven pct lower against the yen and sterling. It had fallen four pct against the Canadian dollar. During the final days of January, pressure on the dollar subsided. Reports of the U.S.-Japanese intervention operation and talk of an upcoming meeting of the major industrial countries encouraged expectations for broader cooperation on exchange rate and economic policy matters, the Fed said. Moreover, doubts had developed about the course of U.S. interest rates. The dollar's swift fall had raised questions about whether the Fed would let short-term rates ease. Thus the dollar firmed to close the period at 1.8320 marks and 153.70 yen. According to the Fed's trade-weighted index, it had declined nine pct since the beginning of the period. The dollar had risen as high as 2.08 marks and 165 yen in early November. The Fed last intervened in the foreign exchange market on November 7, 1985 when it bought a total of 102.2 mln dlrs worth of marks and yen. The Fed's action followed the September 1985 Plaza agreement between the five major industrial nations under which they agreed to promote an orderly decline of the dollar."
ussr seen likely to honor corn commitment,grain corn wheat,"The Soviet Union will likely honor its commitment with the United States to buy a minimum of four mln tonnes of corn this year, an Agriculture Department official said. ""They have always honoured the agreement, and there's no reason now to think they won't this year,"" he told Reuters. ""They have an aggressive buying campaign from the European Community, from Canada, from the U.S. They're active buyers from all sources at this point,"" the official said in explaining why the Department raised its Soviet grain imports estimate today by three mln tonnes to 26 mln tonnes. This is a dramatic shift from just a few months ago when analysts were saying the USSR might not buy any U.S. corn for the first time in 15 years. A drawdown of corn supplies in China and Argentina, concern over Soviet winter crops, and increasing competition for U.S. corn were all cited as possible factors in creating Moscow's recent interest. Lower corn production prospects in some major supplying countries have stirred activity from big buyers such as Japan, and the Soviets are also closely watching the situation, the official said. ""The Soviets will try to out-capitalize the capitalists"" and buy corn before prices get too high, the official said. ""As soon as they need corn, they'll buy it,"" he added. USDA has confirmed one mln tonnes of corn sold to the Soviet Union, but both U.S. and Soviet analysts have said the purchases stand at 1.5 mln tonnes. The USDA official would not speculate on when the Soviets would enter the U.S. market again. ""There has definitely been an evolving mind set -- from the situation of slow grain buying a couple months ago to one of frenetic buying now,"" the official said. However, the situation in wheat is ""a different story,"" he said. Greater world supplies of wheat, heavier Soviet purchase commitments and less competitive U.S. wheat prices make Soviet purchases of U.S. wheat less likely, he said. Speculation has continued for several days that the U.S. is considering making an export bonus wheat subsidy offer to the Soviets, but U.S. officials have provided no confirmation."
sichuan braced to fight drought,grain wheat rice,"The Sichuan government has ordered that any work or meeting which interferes with the fight against drought must be cancelled or postponed to save time, energy and manpower, the People's Daily domestic edition said. Sichuan is one of six provinces threatened by drought. Wen Wei Po, a Hong Kong daily, said the drought, the worst for more than 20 years, is affecting nearly two mln hectares in 100 counties in Sichuan, the country's biggest agricultural producer. Sichuan has experienced temperatures three degrees Centigrade higher than normal and rainfall up to 70 pct less than normal since early February, affecting wheat, oil-bearing crops, rice planting and dryland cash crops, it said. The paper said 43,000 hectares in Meixian county in Guangdong are seriously short of water. The People's Daily said Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu and Hebei are also suffering from drought. Henan's grain output fell by 2.5 mln tonnes last year from the 1985 level because of drought which has been affecting the province since May."
japan may increase its brazilian soybean purchases,oilseed soybean,"Japanese crushers are likely to buy at least 200,000 tonnes of Brazilian soybeans this year and another 100,000 to 200,000 if quality and shipping conditions are good against 128,089 tonnes in 1986, trade sources said. A Japanese trading house recently bought about 31,000 tonnes of soybeans for April 10/May 10 shipment, they said. ""Because Brazilian soybean prices are now some 10 cents a bushel cheaper than U.S. Origin due to the bumper harvest, it is highly likely that Japanese crushers will increase their buying volume,"" one source said. Brazilian beans are available to Japan for shipment from May to July."
australian metal trader links to asturiana de zinc,zinc lead copper,"<Metal Traders Australasia Ltd> said a newly-formed subsidiary, the <Austmet Ltd> group, has negotiated an exclusive long-term contract with Spain's <Asturiana de Zinc> to market its zinc metal exports. Metal Traders said in a statement the contract would underpin the worldwide zinc, copper and lead trading activities of Austmet, a wholly-owned London-based company with a U.S. Unit in Stamford, Connecticut. Austmet has recruited a group of base metal traders, currently operating out of Britain and the U.S., Who have handled Asturiana's business for the past five years, it said. Asturiana has a three-year option to purchase 25 pct of the Austmet group, to be priced on an independent valuation at the time of exercise, Metal Traders said. Austmet will have an initial equity base of one mln stg, a turnover of 200 mln Australian dlrs rising to 300 mln in the first year, and credit lines of up to 30 mln U.S. Dlrs. Austmet should be generating profits from July 1 and a 1.5-2.5 mln dlr net is envisaged within two years, it said. Metal Traders said Asturiana has the largest zinc smelting capacity in Europe -- nearly 200,000 tonnes a year of 99.995 pct high-grade zinc, at Aviles in northern Spain. Metal Traders, a listed company, was formerly <Pyrotech Resources N.L.> whose chief activity was the development and marketing of high-technology smelting processes invented in Australia, notably the Siromelt Zinc Fuming Process. But in late 1986, control of the company changed and it expanded by acquisition into metal trading in Australia and Asia. It then changed its name. It also has the marketing contract for mineral sands produced by <TiO2 Corp N.L.>, of which it holds 17.5 pct. In today's statement, Metal Traders also said it is reviewing possible acquisition of a mineral producer."
japan crushers start april u.s. soybean buying,oilseed soybean,"Japanese crushers, starting to buy U.S. Soybeans for April shipment, have recently made purchases of some 48,000 tonnes, trade sources said. The sources said they could not estimate the total volume to be purchased for April shipping because Japan's crushing program for April and June is unclear. They had predicted earlier that crushers' April shipment U.S. Bean purchases would drop to 260,000 to 270,000 from the monthly average of 300,000 to 330,000 tonnes due to low soybean meal prices."

Taiwan's soybean imports in calendar 1987 are provisionally set at 1.81 mln tonnes compared with a revised 1.74 mln tonnes imported last year. The 1.74 mln tonne figure was revised from 1.76 mln tonnes. Taiwan imports all its soybeans from the United States."
indonesian banks raise interest rates,interest money-fx,"A tight money market has pushed interest rates on three to six month time deposits to between 15 and 18 pct from 13 to 15 pct a month ago, bankers said. March is usually a tight month for the money market because of tax payments and banks' need to attract funds for their year-end accounts on March 31. This year the situation has been made worse by December's rush to buy dollars by companies and businessmen who feared imposition of exchange controls. Much of that outflow has yet to be converted back into rupiah. ""A lot of small money has come back in, but the big money is holding out until after April,"" one U.S. Banker said. The tight money policy of Bank Indonesia, the central bank, is helping to keep rates high. Short-term lending rates now average 25 pct a year, with no prospect they will be lowered soon, the bankers said. Central Bank governor Arifin Siregar said earlier this week that Indonesia could look forward to better economic prospects in 1987/88, but added the ""speculators"" who led a run on the rupiah late last year could again pose problems. Indonesia holds general elections on April 23, the first in five years, and most businessmen expect no new government economic packages or incentives before then. ""Some people are nervous about what the government will do after the election,"" one banker said. ""They normally try to do things before the IGGI (Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia) meeting (in June) to prove they are doing something about the economy to show they deserve a couple of billion dollars."" The IGGI, which groups 14 industrialised donor countries and four agencies, gave Indonesia 2.5 billion dlrs in soft loans and grants last year."
highveld (hgvj.j) sees lower 1987 earnings,earn strategic-metal,"Highveld Steel and Vanadium Corp Ltd said it expects 1987 earnings will be lower than last year's previously reported 85 cts a share. But profits ""will be at a satisfactory level,"" the company said in the annual report without giving a specific estimate. Highveld said it expects appreciation of the rand will be offset to some extent by increasing U.S. Dollar prices for its exports as the year progresses. Highveld said measures taken last year by the European Economic Community and the United States prohibiting all South African steel products ""presents a challenge to management to place the steel in other areas."" The company said overall world vanadium consumption in 1987 is expected to be similar to last year although China's role is still an unknown factor in the total supply-demand situation. ""World vanadium production capacity is still believed to be adequate to cater for any foreseeable demand,"" it added."

korea plans to open markets to ease won pressure,trade bop,"South Korea will further open its market to help cut its trade surplus with the U.S. And to fight off pressure to revalue the won against the dollar, a government spokesman said. The spokesman said Korean trade minister Rha Woong-Bae's stand in Washington yesterday against pressure from industrial nations to revalue the won underlined the government's determination to stand firm. Rha told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ""Demands that Korea carry out a drastic and sudden currency revaluation of five or 10 pct are, I believe, extremely ill-advised."" Deputy prime minister Kim Mahn-Je told a meeting of local businessmen ""The government's policy on the question of revaluing the won is to maintain a steadfast position."" Kim said South Korea was ready to move slowly to raise the won's value because of its heavy foreign debt which stood at 44.5 billion dlrs at the end of 1986. Six industrialised nations agreed in Paris last month that newly industrialising countries, such as South Korea and Taiwan, should allow their currencies to appreciate. But local businessmen have said won/dollar parity has already reached ""a crisis level."" An official of the Korea Traders' Association (KTA) said if the won strengthened another five pct, this would mean the loss of profitability for nearly half of all South Korean exporters. ""We are determined not to go the way of Latin American debtor nations which have suspended interest payments of their debts,"" the spokesman said. ""The only way to keep our good record is to maintain our exports.+ The trade minister said yesterday should Seoul revalue the won suddenly Korea would run ""a tremendous trade deficit and could degenerate into a country, like many other developing countries, which is reneging on its international obligations."" The spokesman said South Korea had been gradually appreciating its currency, ruling out a major revaluation. So far this year, the won has gone up by 0.8 pct against the dollar after a 3.34 pct revaluation in 1986. He said South Korea was selecting ""many"" of 122 items on which Washington recently asked Seoul to lower tariffs to help narrow its trade surplus with the U.S. No further details were given. Seoul announced in January the lifting of bans on 158 items, including sensitive agricultural products and large cars, effective from July. South Korea posted its first ever current account surplus last year, due largely to a trade surplus with the U.S. Of 7.1 billion dlrs, against a 4.3 billion deficit in 1985. It earlier forecast that its current account surplus could reach eight billion dlrs this year. But the government official said the surplus would be held at around five billion dlrs to avoid further pressure by industrialised nations to push up the value of its currency."
spain extends reserve requirement,money-supply interest,"The Bank of Spain has extended the reserve requirement for banks to their convertible peseta funds in an attempt to curb speculation in short-term capital which is currently fuelling money supply growth. In a statement issued late last night, the central bank said convertible peseta accounts, funds which are not subject to exchange controls, would also be subject to a 19 pct reserve requirement with effect from Friday. Convertible peseta funds had been previously exempt from reserve requirements. The measure comes one week after the central bank raised reserve requirements on domestic deposits by one percentage point to 19 pct, also with effect on Friday. Banking sources say the high real interest rates on offer now -- around eight pct for overnight funds -- have attracted a large influx of speculative foreign capital which is threatening the government's monetary targets. They say this influx is largely responsible for Spain's principal measure of money supply, the broad-based liquid assets in public hands (ALP), to have grown by an estimated 17 pct annualised rate in February, compared with January's 8.3 pct rise and an 11.4 pct rise during the whole of 1986. The target for 1987 is eight pct. The Bank of Spain today did not provide assistance funds to banks in a move to drain excess liquidity from the money market. Liquidity will be further tightened by the fortnightly Treasury Bill auction tomorrow and Friday's hike in reserve requirements, expected to absorb over 200 billion pesetas from the system. The immediate reaction was a hike in interbank interest rates today to 13.75/14.00 pct from yesterday's 13.46 pct average for deposits. Bank of Spain officials said this was an understandable response ""given that the market is short of funds."" But banking sources noted that a continued rise in interest rates would neutralize the central bank's attempts to curtail short-term speculation with foreign funds by making the Spanish money markets more attractive."
"japan cannot bear further yen rise, minister says",money-fx yen trade,"Japan cannot bear a further rise of the yen, Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari said. ""A further stronger yen would be a misfortune for Japan and the Japanese people would not be able to bear such a burden,"" he told reporters. The minister said he wants to tell U.S. Political leaders of the sacrifices Japan is making to cut its trade surplus. Kuranari was widely expected to fly to Washington tomorrow for talks focussing on trade. But departure remains uncertain because of the continuing parliamentary boycott by opposition parties protesting plans for a new sales tax. If the boycott is lifted tomorrow, Kuranari would probably have to remain in Japan to attend parliamentary discussions on the government's 1987/88 budget, Japanese officials said. Kuranari said both the U.S. And Japan should approach the trade imbalance in a calm, unemotional manner. But, he added, ""If the issue of rice is to be raised...I would mention the feelings of the Japanese people."" Japanese politicians have said repeatedly the country cannot bow to U.S. Pressure to liberalize rice imports because the issue is too sensitive."
pound and canadian dollar capturing attention,money-fx stg can,"Interest in the currency futures market has shifted to the soaring British pound and the potentially explosive Canadian dollar, and away from the dull Continental and Japanese currencies, analysts said. The June pound, which added 6.3 cents over the past week-and-a-half to reach a new contract high of 1.5930 to the dollar on Monday, has spawned a new-found speculative boom. ""Brokers have to push their clients somewhere...and technically, the pound is in the best shape,"" PaineWebber analyst Jason Gillard said. ""We've tried to take a bullish approach to the pound, and we're going to stay with that, there's no reason to change,"" Smith Barney analyst Craig Sloane said. Many traders took on long pound/short West German mark futures positions, although some of those cross-trades were liquidated yesterday, Sloane said. The fundamental keys to the pound's rise have been relatively high U.K. interest rates and a vague optimism surrounding the British economy, analysts said. ""Money seems to be chasing yields,"" William Byers, of Bear Stearns, said of the 10-1/2 pct U.K. base lending rate. Many analysts are skeptical about further gains in the pound, on the inference that the Bank of England will seek to relieve upward pressure on the currency by pushing down interest rates after the nation's budget is released March 17. The budget itself could have an impact, depending on how well it is received, but analysts say relative interest rates and oil income remain the main influences on the currency. However, the market may be able to absorb lower U.K. interest rates, as it has done when other countries have cut their discount rates, and extend the pound's rally, Sloane said. The Canadian dollar has not been rising like the pound, but Sloane and other analysts cautiously predicted a big move soon. The sideways price pattern in the June contract, with smaller and smaller price ranges, has formed a ""bull flag"" on price charts, technically-oriented analysts said. ""It makes for an explosive type of situation that often leads to a breakout,"" in this case to the upside, Sloane said. Byers agreed there was potential for the June Canadian dollar to rally above the 77.00 cent level from the most recent close at 74.80 cents to the U.S. dollar. ""At this stage of the game I'd call the market long-term positive, but for the technical burden of proof you need a close above (the previous contract high of) 75.25,"" Byers said. As to the traditionally more active currencies, stability was the catchword and reluctance the watchword among analysts. Sloane said it was important that June Swiss francs and June German marks held above support at 0.6400 and 0.5400, respectively, closing at 0.6438 and 0.5430. Yesterday's rebound showed the market was still very respectful of the Paris accord, and the threat of central bank intervention by the G-5 nations plus Canada. ""We may still probe to see what the parameters are,"" Byers said, ""but people are very reluctant because they don't know where the central banks will be (to intervene)."" Gillard said the mark could drop to a previous price consolidation area around 0.5250 based on the profoundly sluggish West German economy, but that he would be a buyer at that level."
vegetable oils may tighten despite seed surplus,oilseed soybean veg-oil palm-oil coconut-oil,"Lower production of coconut and palm oils could lead to a decline in vegetable oil stocks this year despite growing supplies of oilseeds, senior oilseeds analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Mario Balletto said. Balletto told a conference of Canadian farmers at Alberta Agriculture's annual farm outlook conference that the world vegetable oil situation is one of potentially tight supplies. ""Prices for edible oils appear to have more upside potential reflecting strong world demand and an unprecedented decline in the production of tree oils,"" Balletto said. Balletto estimated production of palm, coconut and palm kernel oils this year at 8.5 mln tonnes, down from 9.1 mln tonnes last year, enough to offset higher oilseed output. He estimated total vegetable oil production this year at 33.4 mln tonnes, up from 33.0 mln last year, and disappearance at 34.0 mln tonnes, up from 32.6 mln. Unless oilseed crushing increases sharply, he said, disappearance of vegetable oils could exceed production by 600,000 tonnes, the largest deficit since 1976. ""If world protein meal demand stagnates, thus limiting the crush of soybeans ... the need for serious supply rationing in the edible oils sector could develop,"" he said. ""This would be relatively favorable for the prices of high oil yielding seeds,"" Balletto said. Oilseeds, on the other hand, remain at depressed prices because of burdensome supplies, he said. World ending stocks of oilseeds are estimated to increase for the fourth straight year to a record 28.4 mln tonnes, compared with 25.4 mln last year. The increase should result from lower disappearance, as production is expected to fall to 184.0 mln tonnes from 185.7 mln last year, he said. World soybean production in 1987 totalled a record 98.9 mln tonnes, up from 90.6 mln the previous year, Balletto said, while production of other oilseeds was lower. Higher soybean production in South America and Europe made up for lower production in the United States, he said. Soybeans account for the bulk of the surplus, and U.S. stocks make up most of those, Balletto said. The Commodity Credit Corporation owned 12.7 mln tonnes, about half of the world soybean surplus, he said. Since 1983-84, he said, world oilseed stocks have increased 13.1 mln tonnes. ""During the same period, U.S. soybean stocks increased 12.1 mln tonnes, becoming the dumping ground of the entire world surplus, courtesy of the CCC and highlighting the artificially high prices caused by the U.S. loan program."" ""Soybean prices and, to a great extent, world oilseeds prices are likely to be dominated by the loan program, as long as the U.S. soybean surplus continues. For the 1987 crop, he said, prices are likely to hover in a range tied to the U.S. loan program. ""Upside potential for prices is limited by the huge supply overhang while strong underlying support is provided by the U.S. loan rate."" The problem is likely to become worse as the artificially high prices encourage producers in South America, Canada and Australia to shift from grains to oilseeds, Balletto said."
st. joe gold <sjg> to develop mine,gold silver,"St. Joe Gold Corp said it plans to proceed with development of its Golden Patricia gold property in northwestern Ontario. It said about five mln dlrs will be spent to continue underground development and obtain operating permits and another 10.2 mln dlrs is expected to be required to complete underground development, construct a mill and provide the infrastructure needed to put the mine into commercial production. St. Joe Gold said if the necessary operating permits were granted in time, it would start gold production in the second half of the year ending October 31, 1988 at an annual rate of about 40,000 troy ounces. The company said the property is estimated to contain over 500,000 troy ounces of gold, and the initial mining project covers only seven of 192 claims, with drill-indicated reserves of 293,000 short tons grading 0.88 troy ounce of gold per ton. It said initial mine output is expected to be about 150 tons of ore daily. St. Joe Gold said the Golden Patricia vein has not been tested at depth or along strike to the east and west and exploration is continuing on the Golden Patricia property and the adjacent wholly-owned Muskeg Lake property. The company also said its Richmond Hill gold and silver deposit in the Carbonate district of western South Dakota has been shown by drilling to contain about 3,900,000 tons grading 0.055 troy ounce of gold and 0.23 troy ounce of silver per ton. It said preliminary results are encouraging and a feasibility study is nearing completion."
hungary hopes devaluation will end trade deficit,trade money-fx cpi reserves,"National Bank of Hungary first vice-president Janos Fekete said he hoped a planned eight pct devaluation of the forint will spur exports and redress last year's severe trade deficit with the West. Fekete told Reuters in an interview Hungary must achieve at least equilibrium on its hard currency trade. ""It is useful to have a devaluation,"" he said. ""There is now a real push to our exports and a bit of a curb to our imports."" The official news agency MTI said today Hungary would devalue by eight pct and it expected the new rates to be announced later today. Fekete said the rates would come into effect tomorrow. He said one reason for the devaluation was that Hungary had a higher rate of inflation over the past two years than its main partners (around eight pct in 1985 and between five and 5.5 pct in 1986). This was partly an after-effect of action Hungary took to prevent inflation from soaring during the oil price shocks of the 1970s, he added. Hungary devalued by a similar amount last September and by between three and four pct early last year. But the country's hard currency trade balance nevertheless fell into a deficit of 539.4 mln dlrs from a surplus of 295.3 mln in 1986 and 1.2 billion in 1985. Fekete said Hungary was hoping for a hard currency trade surplus of between 200 and 300 mln dlrs this year, but that a more likely outcome would be closer to equilibrium on total hard currency trade of around 10 billion dlrs. One Western commercial attache here said: ""Devaluation of itself will not change anything. It will only be useful if they also make efforts to restructure industry and improve the quality of their export goods."" Fekete said he hoped to raise credits on good terms this year to invest in restructuring industry. It would be his role to persuade international banks to cooperate in this process. He noted Hungary had been given an AA rating enabling it to raise money on the Japanese Samurai bond market. Hungary's net hard currency debt soared to 7.79 billion dlrs last year from 5.01 billion in 1985, partly because of a current account deficit of 1.42 billion dlrs and partly because the fall in the dollar increased the dollar value of debt denominated in marks or yen. He said he feared net debt would also rise slightly this year, but he was in favour of borrowing for the purpose of modernisation. ""I am for credits to invest for that purpose,"" he said. ""I am against credits for consumption."" He forecast gross domestic product growth of two pct this year, from one pct in 1986. Fekete said Hungary would continue to restructure its debt profile by prepaying high interest shorter and medium term loans with cheaper long term money for which it was looking more and more to the fixed interest rate bond market, where he considered rates to be low. Hard currency foreign exchange reserves would stay at around 3.5 billion dlrs, he said. On the budget deficit, which tripled to a provisional 47 billion forints last year after quadrupling in 1985, Fekete said the finance ministry was working out measures to reduce an approved target deficit for this year of 43.8 billion forints to between 30 and 35 billion forints."

outokumpu restructures copper division,copper earn,"Finland's mining and metals group Outokumpu Oy <OUTO.HE>, which last week reported a 1986 loss of 83 mln markka after three successive years of profits, said it restructured its key copper processing division in an attempt to rationalize production and improve profitability. Outokumpu's Managing Director Pertti Voutilainen told a news conference the reorganization involved a split of the division into a new independent division with six profit centres. Outokumpu group had a 1986 loss before appropriations and taxes of 83 mln markka after a profit of 355 mln in 1985. It had profits in 1984 and 1983 but a loss, 171.2 mln, in 1982. Outokumpu acquired two Swedish copper manufacturers in January 1986, <Metallverken Ab> and <Wirsbo Bruks Ab>, that were merged into its copper processing division. The division had a turnover of 3.2 billion markka last year, 42 pct of Outokumpu's group turnover of 7.58 billion. The new Outokumpu division, called Copper Products Industry, is to incorporate Outokumpu's copper production plants, including its two U.S. Subsidiaries <Nippert Co> and <Valleycast Inc>, as well as Metallverken and part of Wirsbo. Outokumpu is planning to make Wirsbo an independent division in the Outokumpu group and transfer only Wirsbo's copper tube production into one of the new division's profit centres. A definite decision on Wirsbo will be taken later this year. The new division will have production plants in Finland, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands and the U.S."
u.s. trade deficit 38.37 billion dlrs in 4th qtr,bop trade,"The U.S. merchandise trade deficit on a balance of payments basis was a record 38.37 billion dlrs in the October to December fourth quarter, the Commerce Department said. The record trade shortfall came after a revised 37.15 billion dlr third quarter deficit. The department previously reported the third quarter deficit was 37.67 billion dlrs. For the full year 1986, the merchandise trade deficit was a record 147.7 billion dlrs, up from 124.4 billion dlrs in 1985, the department said. During the final quarter last year imports rose 2.78 billion dlrs or three pct to 95.7 billion dlrs, while exports rose 1.56 billion dlrs or three pct to 57.33 billion dlrs. The trade report on a balance of payments basis excludes such factors as military sales and the costs of shipping and insurance. The Commerce Department said non-petroleum imports in the quarter were up 2.7 billion dlrs or three pct to 87.7 billion dlrs, with the largest increases in consumer goods, which rose 1.2 billion dlrs, and in non-monetary gold and passenger cars from Canada, up 900 mln dlrs each. Lumber imports from Canada fell 300 mln dlrs or 33 pct because of a 15 pct duty on imports from Canada, the department said. Passenger car imports fell 600 mln dlrs because of an 18 pct decrease in the number of South Korean-made imported cars and a nine pct decrease from Japan. On the exports side, agricultural exports rose 600 mln dlrs or nine pct to 7.1 billion dlrs, primarily because of a 104 pct or 600 mln dlr increase in soybean exports. Soybean shipments to Western Europe rose sharply because supplies from Brazil, a traditional major exporter, were limited by drought. Commerce said the U.S. trade deficit with Latin America rose 900 mln dlrs to 2.6 billion dlrs, with Japan increased 700 mln dlrs to 14.8 billion dlrs and with Western Europe rose 200 mln to 7.2 billion dlrs in the quarter. The deficit with newly industrialized Far East countries, including Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, fell 500 mln dlrs to eight billion dlrs and with Canada the deficit decreased 200 mln dlrs to 3.3 billion dlrs in the quarter. In the full year 1986, imports rose 30.6 billion dlrs or nine pct to 369.5 billion dlrs. Exports increased by only 7.3 billion dlrs or three pct to 221.8 billion dlrs. Commerce said petroleum imports during 1986 fell 16.6 billion dlrs or 33 pct to 33.9 billion dlrs because of lower prices. The average price per barrel decreased to 14.72 dlrs from 26.41 dlrs. Agricultural exports fell by 2.6 billion dlrs or nine pct to 26.9 billion during the year. The average price of rice fell 27 pct, cotton was down 22 pct, corn 18 pct, wheat 16 pct and soybeans nine pct. The trade deficit with Japan for all of 1986 rose 11.1 billion dlrs to 54.6 billion dlrs and with Western Europe increased 7.2 billion dlrs to 28.6 billion dlrs."

Licht estimates European beet plantings this year at 7.22 mln hectares compared with a revised 1986 figure of 7.21 mln, traders said. In its first estimate for 1987, it puts EC plantings at 1.85 mln hectares compared with 1.89 mln in 1986, while it estimates sowings in Western Europe (including EC) at 2.49 mln hectares compared with 2.50 mln in 1986. Traders said Licht forecasts Eastern Europe plantings at 4.73 mln hectares against 4.72 mln in 1986."
china buys u.s. hard and soft wheat,grain wheat,"Private exporters said China bought a total of 550,000 tonnes of U.S. wheat under the export enhancement program, with final confirmation by the U.S. Department of Agriculture of the subsidies still awaited. The purchase consisted of a total of 340,000 tonnes of hard red winter wheat for various May/Aug shipments, with 210,000 tonnes of soft red winter for Aug/Sept, the exporters said."
energy/foreign investors,crude nat-gas,"Lured by the weakening dollar and the conviction that oil prices are poised for a rebound, European energy companies are buying up cheap U.S. oil and gas reserves to replenish their supplies, oil industry analysts said. They said owning oil reserves in a politically stable United States is good insurance against future shortages. However, the quick pace of foreign investment has heated up competition among European firms, well-heeled U.S. institutional investors and major oil companies to snare choice domestic oil properties. Strevig and Associates, a Houston firm that tracks oil and gas reserve sales, said growing interest among foreign buyers had helped push reserve prices in recent months higher. All buyers of U.S. reserves paid a median price of 6.45 dlrs a barrel of oil during the fourth quarter of 1986 for acquisitions, up from 5.33 dlrs in the third quarter and five dlrs in the second quarter, according to the firm's research. ""Foreign investors have been here nibbling a long time, but we're seeing new names and smaller companies coming in,"" said Arthur Smith, an oil property appraisal specialist and president of John S. Herold Inc in Greenwich, Conn. ""Europeans, especially, do not have much indigenous oil and gas and realize the tide will eventually turn in favor of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,"" he added. Smith and other oil industry analyst and economists believe the trend in foreign investments will continue in 1987 because of the fall in value of the U.S. dollar, the perception that oil prices have hit bottom and the fact that it is cheaper to buy new reserves than to explore for them. Plenty of properties are available on the market, thanks to the need of many companies to raise cash for debt payments and general restructuring throughout the oilpatch. In two of the biggest transactions of recent months, French-owned Minatome Corp., a unit of <Total Compagnie Francaise des Petroles>, spent more than 230 mln dlrs to separately acquire oil assets of Texas International <TEICC> and Lear Petroleum Partners <LPP>. A spokesman for Minatome said the company is searching for additional acquisitions. A partnership of two Belgian-owned firms, <Petrofina S.A.> and <Cometra Oil S.A.> paid 150 mln dlrs late last year to buy virtually all the exploration assets of the Williams Cos <WMB>, the Oklahoma pipeline firm. But Japanese investors prefer entering into joint ventures with experienced U.S. companies to explore for new oil. Japan's <Nippon Oil> is a partner of Texaco Inc's <TX> Texaco USA in a 100 mln dlrs U.S. drilling program, and has joined with Dupont's <DD> Conoco Inc in a similar 135 dlrs mln deal. Most buyers said the pay-back period of a property, its geographic location and the lifting cost of the crude oil are more important factors in evaluating potential acquisitions than relying on a simple price-per-barrel formula. Rich Hodges, a Houston-based land manager representing International Oil and Gas Corp, a partnership of <Preussag Corp> and <C. Deilmann Inc> of West Germany, said the firm had earmarked at least 50 mln dlrs to spend on oil reserves in Texas, Oklahoma or Louisiana in the coming months. But he called that a small amount compared to the amount other investors have for acquisitions. PaineWebber's Geodyne Energy Income Fund, for example, has said it plans to spend up to 300 mln dlrs on oil and gas properties. ""The competition is stiff, not only from other foreign investors but from the brokerage houses and U.S. oil companies,"" he said. ""Our company is shopping around because we feel it's substantially less risky than pure exploration. If you're going to take the risk inherent in exploration, you need prices higher than the current market,"" he added. In addition to the foreign investors and U.S. brokerage houses, analysts said many of the major oil companies were also competing for prime properties. Houston-based Shell Oil Co, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD>, has been one of the most active companies in buying and selling reserves, Smith said. Since 1982, Shell has acquired two billion dlrs in new reserves, including 470 mln barrels of oil equivalent at a net cost of 2.80 dlrs a barrel, he said. ""Buying reserves is a good strategy for most of these companies,"" Smith said. ""Domestic production has dropped by one mln barrels a day because of cutbacks in drilling and it may drop by another one mln barrels a day in 1988."""
dole says 0/92 option should be considered,grain corn,"U.S. Senate Republican leader Robert Dole said Congress should consider legislation to apply the so-called 0/92 option to producers of major commodities. Dole told the National Corn Growers Association that he thought the proposal, supported by the Reagan administration, ""should be seriously considered"" because a refusal to do so could ""play into the hands of those who want mandatory controls"" placed on production. However, Dole did not say whether he would support the 0/92 option, which would offer producers at least 92 pct of their income support payments regardless of how much they planted. The Senate Republican leader said the 0/92 option posed two problems. First, it is viewed, he said, by some as welfare. In addition, debate on the proposal could open up the whole farm bill, Dole said. Dole also repeated his call for an across-the-board export enhancement program, saying a subsidy offer to the Soviet Union could help improve U.S. relations with that country. Dole said that the United States has made the decision to trade with Moscow and that it's important to offer competitive prices. The senator predicted Congress would have to decide this year whether to require an expansion of the export subsidy program, which currently targets benefits to recapture markets lost to other suppliers which subsidize. Dole, who last year pledged to offer legislation to require a marketing loan for major crops but never did so, again called for the marketing loan for wheat and feedgrains. The Reagan administration's proposed farm policy changes ""are not going anywhere"" this year, Dole said, singling out the proposal to cut target prices 10 pct per year. Asked by reporters after his speech whether he sensed a shift in the State Department towards supporting an export enhancement initiative for the Soviet Union, Dole said he didn't see any change. Dole also said it would be a very close call in the Senate whether to open up the farm bill to general debate this year. Dole said he was encouraged by the selection of Republican David Karnes to replace the late Sen. Edward Zorinsky (D-Neb.)"
dole mulls bill to extend ethanol tax exemption,gas grain corn,"U.S. Senate Republican leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.) said he and a group of Republican lawmakers are considering introducing legislation to extend the ethanol tax exemption through the year 2000. Dole, addressing the National Corn Growers Association board, said the proposal was under consideration by a rural task force of Republican members of Congress and governors. Gasoline containing at least 10 pct ethanol now receives a six cents per gallon exemption from a nine cent federal excise tax. The exemption is to expire the end of 1992. Ethanol is produced primarily by a few large agribusiness firms including Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) and A.E. Staley. The tax exemption has helped bolster ethanol production despite a sharp drop in the prices of competing crude oil."
peru guerrillas interrupt train route to mines,copper zinc silver,"Maoist guerrillas using dynamite derailed two locomotives and four train wagons, interrupting traffic on Peru's sole railway line linking the capital to the central Andes, where most of the country's mining centres are located, authorities said. Damages was estimated at 800,000 dlrs in the dynamite blast yesterday at Chacapalca, where the explosion wrecked the train laden with minerals and 45 metres of the railway line. Crews hoped to restore traffic to the line later today after clearing the damaged train and repairing the tracks at Chacapalca, 225 km east of the Capital, Lima. An official at Mineroperu comercial (Minpeco), Peru's state minerals marketing firm, said the agency was assessing the situation. There had not been a declaration of force majeure on contracts to ship minerals abroad. Foreign sales of silver, copper, zinc and other minerals earn Peru over half of its export income. Most of the minerals, extracted and refined in the central peruvian andes, are shipped down the central railway to the lima port of callao."
placer <plc> to increase stake in equity silver,acq silver,"<Equity Silver Mines Ltd> said it agreed to sell 6.6 mln shares of a new class of par value voting stock to Placer Development Ltd for 37.1 mln dlrs, increasing Placer's stake in Equity to 74.5 pct from 68 pct. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and a vote by Equity minority shareholders at the April 23 annual meeting, the company said. Proceeds from sale of the shares, priced at 5.625 dlrs each, will be used to buy and deliver 4,985,000 ounces of silver to Placer, Equity said. Equity Silver said the silver remains to be delivered under its sale agreement with Placer, after delivery of its 750,000 ounce minimum commitment for 1987. Equity said it arranged to acquire 4,985,000 ounces of silver at 7.40 dlrs an ounces, subject to selling the shares to Placer. Purchase and delivery of the silver to Placer will result in an after-tax gain of about 6.6 mln dlrs, Equity said. It also said the stock and silver transactions will create a 37,059,000 dlr fund out of which dividends will be paid when cash is available. The cash fund will enable Equity Silver to continue to pay dividends on its preferred shares and increase the likelihood that it may be able to pay dividends on its common shares, the company said. It did not elaborate on what common share dividends might be paid. The company normally pays quarterly preferred dividends totalling 619,000 dlrs from retained earnings, Equity Silver said. Equity Silver had retained earnings of 2,312,000 dlrs at December 31, 1986."
brazil's sarney meets strikes with show of force,crude ship,"With troops in place in Brazil's ports and oil installations, the government of Prersident Jose Sarney today sought to end a wave of labour unrest by a show of force. Yesterday the government sent thousands of troops supported in some instances by tanks to occupy nine oil refineries and six areas of oil production. The state-oil company Petrobras requested the intervention because of a threatened strike by 55,000 oil industry employees. The government had already dispatched more than 1,000 marines to occupy the country's main ports after a national seamen's strike was ruled illegal last Friday. The strike by 40,000 seamen, now in its 13th day, represents a stern challenge to the government. The stoppage has delayed exports at a time when Brazil desperately needs foreign exchange. It was a deterioration in the country's trade balance which precipitated Brazil's current debt crisis and the decision on February 20 to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt. There was no sign today of an early end to the seamen's strike, which has badly hit the port of Santos -- the most important in South America -- and the country's other main ports. Small groups of marines armed with submachineguns stand on the quays near the strike-bound ships, but the military presence here is generally discreet. A total of 800 marines are inside the docks but most are out of sight. Yesterday marines and police occupied one ship, the Docemarte, seamen's leaders said. After explaining to the captain that the strikers faced up to one year in jail because the strike was illegal, the men returned to work. One of the strike leaders, Elmano Barbosa, said ""it is a psychological war. They are using force and we are using peaceful methods."" Port sources said only two Brazilian ships in Santos, the Docemarte and the Henrique Leal, were working. At the seamen's national strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro, spokesmen say a total of about 190 ships are strike-bound in Brazil and in foreign ports. Contradicting earlier reports from strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro, seamen in Santos said the strikers on board ships here were not running out of food. The current labour unrest is the worst faced by Sarney's civilian government since it came to power two years ago. Yesterday, in a separate protest, hundreds of thousands of farmers held rallies directed largely against high bank interest rates. The current rash of labour unrest in industry and agriculture stems from the failure of the government's now-collapsed Cruzado Plan price freeze."

The contract provides for the delivery of 48,000 lbs, plus or minus two pct, of bulk HFCS-55 meeting specified standards regarding its physical and chemical properties. CFTC said the exchange plans to begin trading a July 1987 HFCS-55 contract on April 6. CFTC said the soft drink industry currently buys at least 95 pct of all U.S.-produced HFCS-55, a liquid food and beverage sweetener produced through the processing of corn starch by corn refiners."
argentine meat exports lower in 1986,carcass livestock,"Argentine meat exports during Jan/Dec 1986 totalled 220,911 tonnes, against 223,204 tonnes shipped in the same 1985 period, the National Meat board said. Shipments in tonnes with comparative figures for the 1985 period, in brackets, included: beef 120,184 (137,686), horse meat 25,651 (33,892) and beef offal 50,100 (47,745). Argentina's meat exports totalled 20,481 tonnes in December 1986, against 15,801 tonnes in the same 1985 month.

The bonus awards were made to Cargill, Inc (305,000 tonnes), Continental Grain Co (155,000 tonnes), Mitsubishi International Corp (60,000 tonnes) and Richco Grain Co (30,000 tonnes). Bonuses will be paid to the exporters in the form of commodities from CCC stocks. The purchases complete the Export Enhancement Program initiative for China announced Jan 26."
venezuela moves closer to champlin purchase,acq crude,"the council of ministers approved petroleos de venezuela's planned purchase of a half interest in the champlin petroleum refinery at corpus christi, texas, government sources said. The cabinet authorized energy and mines minister arturo hernandez grisanti to approve the purchase in the shareholders assembly of the state oil company petroleos de venezuela (pdvsa). Pdvsa last april 14 signed a letter of intent to buy a half interest in champlin's corpus christi refinery for an undisclosed sum. Under the terms of the provisional agreement, venezuela would supply up to 160,000 barrels a day to the plant through a new company which would be jointly owned by the pdvsa and champlin, a subsidiary of the union pacific corp <unp>. The deal would also allow pdvsa a joint share in champlin's refinery and distribution network. The purhcase is one of a series of overseas joint ventures by which venezuela has managed to assure markets for some 400,000 barrels of its approximately 1.5 mln bpd exports. Hernandez grisanti told reporters after the cabinet meeting that pdvsa will pay 93 mln dlrs for its half ownership in the champlin refinery - 33 mln dlrs in cash and 60 mln dlrs crude oil and products. Through the deal, he said, venezuela will be assured the sale of at least 140,000 bpd of crude and products. Hernandez said pdsva has entered similar joint ventures with veba oel of west germany, nynas petroelum in sweden, and citgo in the united states."
oregon lumber company to sell wood to iraq,lumber plywood,"A Portland-based wood products company has signed a 13 mln dlr contract with the Iraqi government to supply finished softwood lumber to Iraq, Edward Niedermeyer, president of Niedermeyer-Martin Co said yesterday. Niedermeyer told the House Foreign Affairs sub-committee on International Economic Policy and Trade in Washington that the sales agreement contains an option that could make lumber exported worth more than 20 mln dlrs. The delivery of about 8.0 mln dlrs worth of plywood, in addition to lumber, hinges on whether the U.S. Department of Agriculture will interpret plywood as an agricultural commodity under the credit guarantee program, he said. Niedermeyer said the government export credit guarantee program (GSM-102) administered by the USDA was the key to opening the Iraqi market which up to now had been captured by Scandinavian lumber producers. ""This is the first time we have been able to sell wood products in Iraq, he said. Without the USDA program it would not have been possible. We hope this will lead to a long term export market for U.S. lumber products."" He said the contract calls for supplying 21 mln board feet to 30 mln board feet of softwood lumber for housing, construction and furniture manufacturing. He estimated the profit potential for his company on the sale at five to six pct. Niedermeyer spent two weeks in Baghdad negotiating the sale late last month and early March. He is a member of the United States-Iraq Business Forum, a non-profit group designed to promote commerce with Iraq. The forum members include Westinghouse and General Electric, but Niedermeyer's company is the only wood products firm on the membership roster."
"u.s. corn demand growing in japan, south korea",grain corn,"The recent purchase of 1.5 mln tonnes of U.S. corn by Japan and 600,000 tonnes by South Korea suggests that the two countries' demand for reliable supplies of corn is increasing, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. In its World Production and Trade Report, the department said that view is reinforced by the expectation of a decline in exportable supplies of Argentine corn and uncertainty over the availability of South African and Chinese corn. With these corn purchases, Japan is committed to buying 7.7 mln tonnes of U.S. corn in 1986/87 (Sept-Aug), nearly 400,000 tonnes greater than year-ago figures to date. South Korea's cumulative commitments amount to 2.5 mln tonnes, up 1.5 mln compared to last year, it said."

In its World Production and Trade Report, the department said the increase in tariffs on this category which includes sunflower, corn and rapeseed oils, was a reaction to importers using basket categories to avoid paying tariffs on specific high-tariff products."
brazil coffee exports disrupted by strike,coffee ship,"An 11-day-old strike by Brazilian seamen is affecting coffee shipments and could lead to a short term supply squeeze abroad, exporters said. They could not quantify how much coffee has been delayed but said at least 40 pct of coffee exports are carried by Brazilian ships and movement of foreign vessels has also been disrupted by port congestion caused by the strike. A series of labor disputes and bad weather has meant Brazil's coffee exports have been running at an average two weeks behind schedule since the start of the year, one source added. By the end of February shipments had fallen 800,000 bags behind registrations, leaving around 2.4 mln bags to be shipped during March. By March 10 only 230,000 bags had been shipped, the sources said. Given Brazil's port loading capacity of around 100,000 bags a day, even if normal operations were resumed immediately and not interrupted by bad weather, some March registered coffee will inevitably be shipped during April, they added."
big u.s. conservation enrollment expected,grain corn soybean oilseed,"Enrollment in the U.S. Agriculture Department's fourth conservation signup is expected to be announced tomorrow, and USDA officials said the figure may be higher than total enrollment for the first three signups. Enrollment will be in the range of seven to 12 mln acres, USDA conservation specialists said. Total enrollment so far in the 10-year conservation program is 8.9 mln acres. Producers submitted bids to enter 11 to 12 mln acres into the program, Milton Hertz, administrator for USDA's Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service said at a congressional hearing yesterday. Not all the bids will be accepted, Hertz said, but enrollment is expected to be high. As in the first three signups, the Great Plains area is expected to attract the greatest enrollment. ""The Great Plains area will be the predominate area which we'll get signup in,"" a USDA conservation specialist said. Marginal corn acreage will likely be the bulk of the acreage pulled from that area, he said. Fringe soybean acres in the southeast and some bean acreage in the midwest are also expected to be taken out of production, but the USDA source said this would be a relatively small percent of the total. A special two dlr bonus to corn producers who enroll part of their corn base acreage into the program has sparked more interest in this latest signup, USDA officials said. Under the program, USDA pays farmers annual rents to take land out of production for 10 years. The average rent payment accepted in the first three signups was 43.50 dlrs per acre."
more heavy rains in argentine grain areas,grain corn sorghum sunseed oilseed,"Heavy rains fell again in Argentina's main grain growing areas in the week to yesterday, trade sources said. Rains fell heaviest early in the week, and in particularly high volume in Buenos Aires province, Cordoba, La Pampa and Santa Fe provinces. Rainfall totalled between 20 and 290 mm in Buenos Aires, heaviest in western sectors of the province, 20 to 145 mm in La Pampa, 25 to 120 mm in Cordoba, and 10 to 75 mm in Santa Fe. Rainfall was lighter in other provinces. Rainfall totalled from five to 50 mm in Corrientes, five to 31 mm in San Luis, five to 30 mm in Entre Rios, three to 20 mm in Misiones, 11 to 17 mm in Formosa and one to eight mm in Chaco. Growers said it was still too early to tell whether the rains had damaged crops, though they said maize and sunflower crops may have suffered. Harvesting of both those crops and sorghum was paralysed by the bad weather. For harvesting to resume as normal, the rains would have to stop long enough for the soil to dry and allow farm machinery to operate. The rains caused flooding in western and northwestern Buenos Aires, as more than 750 mm have fallen in some areas there since February 23 while the annual average is 1,200 mm. Flooded areas total between 1.2 and 1.5 mln hectares, Buenos Aires province governor Alejandro Armendariz said after flying over the flooded area. Agriculture Secretary Ernesto Figueras said only 500,000 hectares of the area now flooded had been planted, and that 200,000 to 300,000 hectares could be lost. Growers said large parts of the flooded areas were not planted because they are low-lying and flood easily. Trade sources said it was certain crops were damaged by the heavy rains but it was too early to tell the exact extent of the damage. They said it was likely rain combined with high winds uprooted many sunflower and maize plants. The sunflower harvest moved forward in the centre and south of Cordoba and Santa Fe and got underway in a few isolated areas of northern Buenos Aires. Growers have harvested between 15 and 18 pct of total planted area, up from seven to nine pct a week ago. Estimates of the total volume of the sunflower crop were revised downward in light of the bad weather. Estimates for total crop ranged from 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes, down from 2.4 to 2.7 mln tonnes estimated last week and down 34.1 to 41.5 pct from last year's record harvest of 4.1 mln tonnes. Maize harvesting also advanced, reaching between 13 and 15 pct of total planted area compared to seven to nine pct a week ago. The maize harvest is expected to total between 10 and 10.2 mln tonnes, down from the 10 to 10.4 mln tonnes estimated a week ago. Last year's maize harvest totalled 12.8 mln tonnes, according to official figures. Soybean production estimates were revised downward, to 7.8 to 8.2 mln tonnes compared to estimates of eight to 8.4 mln tonnes a week ago. Last year's soybean harvest totalled 7.1 mln tonnes, according to official figures. Sorghum harvesting moved slowly forward, reaching between four and six pct of total planted area, compared to two to four pct a week ago. Sorghum production estimates remained steady at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes, down 16.7 to 22 pct from the 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest."
recent u.s. oil demand up 1.9 pct from year ago,gas fuel crude,"U.S. oil demand as measured by products supplied rose 1.9 pct in the four weeks ended March six to 16.39 mln barrels per day from 16.08 mln in the same period a year ago, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said. In its weekly petroleum status report, the Energy Department agency said distillate demand was down 2.2 pct in the period to 3.33 mln bpd from 3.40 mln a year earlier. Gasoline demand averaged 6.75 mln bpd, up 3.3 pct from 6.53 mln last year, while residual fuel demand was 1.40 mln bpd, off 2.7 pct from 1.43 mln, the EIA said. Domestic crude oil production was estimated at 8.38 mln bpd, down 8.5 pct from 9.15 mln a year ago, and gross daily crude imports (excluding those for the SPR) averaged 3.67 mln bpd, up 23 pct from 2.97 mln, the EIA said. Refinery crude runs in the four weeks were 12.05 mln bpd, up 1.5 pct from 11.87 mln a year earlier, it said. Year-to-date figures will not become available until March 26 when EIA's Petroleum Supply Monthly data for January 1987 becomes available, the agency said."
u.s. economic data key to debt futures outlook,interest retail ipi,"U.S. economic data this week could be the key in determining whether U.S. interest rate futures break out of a 3-1/2 month trading range, financial analysts said. Although market expectations are for February U.S. retail sales Thursday and industrial production Friday to show healthy gains, figures within or slightly below expectations would be positive for the market, the analysts said. ""You have to be impressed with the resiliency of bonds right now,"" said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig Sloane. Treasury bond futures came under pressure today which traders linked to a persistently firm federal funds rate and a rise in oil prices. However, when sufficient selling interest to break below chart support in the June contract failed to materialize, participants who had sold bond futures early quickly covered short positions, they said. ""Everyone is expecting strong numbers, and if they come in as expected it won't be that bad for the market,"" Sloane said. Sloane said the consensus estimate for the non-auto sector of retail sales is for a rise of 0.6 to 0.7 pct. Dean Witter analyst Karen Gibbs said a retail sales figure below market forecasts would give a boost to debt futures, and she put the range for the non-auto sector of retail sales at up 0.8 to 1.2 pct. Industrial production and the producer price index Friday both are expected to show increases of about 0.5 pct, she added. Retail sales ""will tell us whether or not we will be able to fill the gap,"" Gibbs said, referring to a chart gap in June bonds between 100-26/32 and 101-3/32 created Friday. June bonds closed at 100-4/32 today. Also key to debt futures direction, in addition to the federal funds rate, is the direction of crude oil prices, said Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures analyst Brian Singer. ""A higher fed funds rate and firm oil prices precluded the market from breaking out of the trading range the last time the market approached the top of the range,"" Singer said. In order for bonds to break above the top of the range, which is just below 102 in the June contract, ""the crude oil rally needs to run its course and pull back a little bit,"" Singer said. ""Fed funds are already easing back down toward the six pct level."" The recent surge in oil prices has also been a concern to Manufacturers Hanover Futures analyst Jim Rozich, but the rally may be nearing a top around 18.50 dlrs per barrel, he said. Rozich said he is looking for the June bond contract to ease to 99-6/32 and find support. ""I'm not quite ready to jump on the bullish bandwagon yet. The jury is still out this week,"" Rozich said."
"usx <x> proved oil, gas reserves fall in 1986",crude nat-gas iron-steel,"USX Corp said proved reserves of oil and natural gas liquids fell 28 pct to 802.8 mln barrels at the end of 1986 from 1.12 billion barrels at year-end 1985. The figures, in USX's just-released 1986 annual report, indicate much of the drop resulted from the exclusion of 293.7 mln barrels of Libyan reserves, after the U.S. government last June directed U.S. oil companies to end Libyan operations. USX, which owns Marathon Oil Co and Texas Oil and Gas Corp, had 60 pct of its 1986 sales of 14.94 billion dlrs from its oil and gas operations. About 24 pct of total sales came from USX's USS steel unit and 16 pct from diversified businesses, which include oilfield services, raw materials, minerals, chemicals and real estate. According to the report, domestic liquids reserves fell slightly to 628.5 mln barrels from 628.9 mln and foreign reserves fell to 174.3 mln from 486.4 mln barrels. The large drop in foreign reserves was in the Middle East and Africa, where they fell to about 9.3 mln barrels from 316.7 mln, reflecting the exclusion of Libya. Total natural gas reserves fell to 4.82 trillion cubic feet at year-end 1986 from 5.18 trillion at the end of 1985. Again, most of the drop came from the Middle East and Africa, where reserves fell to zero from 71.9 billion cubic feet, excluding Libyan reserves. U.S. natural gas reserves fell to 3.44 trillion cubic feet from 3.65 trillion and foreign reserves fell to 1.38 trillion from 1.53 trillion. In other areas, USX said total capital spending fell to 962 mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.78 billion dlrs in 1985. The 1986 audited figure is eight mln dlrs higher than the unaudited figure the company reported on Jan 27. USX also said it expects to record a gain of 150 mln dlrs in 1988, representing 50 pct of previously existing investment tax credits allowable under the new tax law. The loss of the other half of the credits was reflected in the fourth quarter. In a discussion of steel results, USX said plants that were shut down last month and some previously idled plants may be permanently closed. USX took a fourth quarter charge of 1.03 billion dlrs to restructure its steel operations. The charge included the ""indefinite idling"" last month of four plants in Utah, Pennsylvania and Texas. Other plants or parts of plants in Pennsylvania, Indiana, Alabama, Ohio and Chicago had been previously idled. ""These operations are not permanently shut down. Improved market conditions for the products from these plants may make it feasible to reopen some of them,"" USX said in the report. ""On the other hand, a lack of any future market improvement may necessitate their permanent closing,"" it added."

The maize import target for calendar 1987 is set at well over 3.4 mln tonnes compared with an actual 3.07 mln in 1985, he added."
economic spotlight - mitsubishi heavy fights back,ship iron-steel,"International efforts to redirect Japan's export-driven economy toward domestic consumption face heavy going if the country's largest defence contractor and world's biggest shipbuilder is anything to go by. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd <MITH.T> (MHI), which began making ships and iron goods for Japan's military rulers 130 years ago, is responding to the strong yen by redoubling its efforts to maintain its share of export markets. ""If we sell the best quality and the cheapest products, everyone will buy them,"" MHI president Yotaro Iida said. Although two of MHI's main businesses, shipbuilding and power plant construction, have been hit hard by the yen's 40 pct rise against the dollar, the company has no plans to abandon them, Iida told Reuters in an interview. Its other big activity, aircraft component manufacture, has performed so well that MHI now accounts for half of the money Tokyo spends on defence procurement each year. ""We have made the utmost efforts among the world's manufacturers to improve productivity,"" he said. ""You may be surprised if you come to see our plants. The outside is old but the inside is ultra-modern, with robots and computers."" Securities analysts at major securities houses agreed that MHI has pared costs more quickly than its competitors. The company has slashed its workforce to 47,000 from 86,000 in 1976. Despite its cost-cutting, MHI expects profits to drop 40 pct to 30 billion yen in the current fiscal year ending March 31, from 1985/86's record 50.14 billion. And that includes gains from the sale of MHI's stake in Mitsubishi Motors Corp <MIMT.T> for 49 billion yen. Iida is optimistic about the future, however. He said a resurgence of demand from the Middle East following the recent recovery in oil prices coupled with persistent demand for power plants in developing countries will help MHI restore its exports-to-sales ratio to the past decade's average of 30 pct. MHI's exports-to-sales ratio fell to 25.9 pct in the half-year ended last September, from 35 to 36 pct five years ago. China is the most promising market, although MHI also considers other non-oil-producing developing countries as major customers. ""Our customers are all seen as being in trouble due to a lack of foreign currency,"" Iida said. But he added that he felt MHI could sell to those markets with Japanese government financial support. It can also finance the plants itself and recover its investment through product sales, a strategy Iida said could prove popular in the future. In shipping, MHI is fighting back against low-priced South Korean competition by building more technologically advanced carriers to carry liquefied natural gas and other products difficult to transport. Shipbuilders Association officials told Reuters MHI is the world's largest shipbuilder in terms of orders and capacity. Domestically, MHI is involved in 12 national projects, including development of nuclear fusion reactors and launch vehicles for man-made satellites. It has been the biggest contractor for the Japan Defence Agency's F-15 and F-14 jet fighters and missiles, although all of these have been built under licence from U.S. Firms. MHI is now heading up five Japanese companies seeking to develop the country's own fighter plane to replace the currently used F-1 support fighters in the late 1990s. Military experts said Washington is putting strong pressure on Tokyo to buy a U.S. Plane, either the McDonnell Douglas Corp F-18 or General Dynamics Corp F-16, to reduce Japan's huge trade surplus with the U.S. ""It might be a good idea to jointly produce planes with U.S. Makers as Japan is supported by the U.S. Defence umbrella,"" Iida said. MHI also plans to cooperate with the U.S. In its Strategic Defence Initiative space defence program by participating in the project when it moves from the research stage, he said. The U.S. Has been seeking Japan's technological support. In fiscal 1985/86, aircraft accounted for 17.1 pct of MHI's sales, shipbuilding 17 pct and power plants 27.9 pct. Iida said the ideal ratio is power plants 30 pct, aircraft and special vehicles 25 pct and shipbuilding 15 pct. As for the remaining 30 pct, Iida said he wanted to shift the domestic focus away from heavy machinery sold to manufacturers and towards household goods, but he declined to specify which products. ""By the end of this year, you may find our brand name on your daily products, although this does not mean we will run away from our mainstream business,"" he said."
awb says australian wheat sales over 10 mln tonnes,grain wheat,"The Australian Wheat Board's (AWB) 1986/87 export program is well advanced with over 10 mln tonnes already sold, AWB general manager Ron Paice said. ""We are certainly within reach of our 15 mln tonne export target for the year,"" he said in a statement. He did not detail the commitments already made, but an AWB spokesman said they include sales to Egypt, China, Iran, the Soviet Union and Iraq. In the 1985/86 wheat year ended September 30, the AWB exported a record 15.96 mln tonnes. Paice also said the 1986/87 Australian wheat harvest has ended after a long, cool summer with 15.14 mln tonnes delivered to the AWB. The season produced another good crop, with only 0.2 pct of receivals being downgraded to feed quality, he said. However, it is likely that some weather-damaged grain was still being held on farms and further milling and feed wheat may be delivered following the recent announcement of the final Guaranteed Minimum Price for 1986/87, he said. Paice did not give a crop estimate, but the AWB's February Wheat Australia publication put the crop at 16.7 mln tonnes. But the AWB spokesman said it is likely this estimate could turn out to be too high, based on the receivals level, and the final crop figure would probably be nearer to 16.2 mln tonnes. The official estimate is not yet available. In the 1985/86 season, the AWB received 15.08 mln tonnes of the 16.13 mln tonne crop. Another 422,000 tonnes was retained on-farm and 620,000 sold under the permit system introduced in 1984/85 to allow farmers to sell feed wheat to the grain trade outside the AWB's receival system, according to Bureau of Agricultural Economics data."

french 1986 current account surplus revised,bop trade,"The French 1986 current account balance of payments surplus has been revised slightly upwards to 25.8 billion francs from the 25.4 billion franc figure announced last month, the Finance Ministry said. This compares with a 1.5 billion deficit in 1985, and while it is the first surplus since 1979, is substantially lower than the 50 billion surplus forecast by the previous socialist government before they lost office in March last year. Net long-term capital outflows rose sharply to 70.5 billion francs last year from 8.8 billion in 1985, largely due to a major program of foreign debt repayment, the ministry said. In the fourth quarter alone the unadjusted surplus rose to 14.1 billion francs from 6.6 billion the previous quarter, but the adjusted surplus fell to 7.4 billion from 9.1 billion. Fourth quarter medium and long-term foreign debt repayments exceeded new credits by 11 billion francs."

taiwan clamps new controls on currency inflows,money-fx reserves,"Taiwan's new controls on currency inflows, implemented today, are a desperate bid to stem a flood of speculative money prompted by the local currency surge against the U.S. Dollar, local and foreign bankers said. The central bank now has to clear remittances exceeding one mln U.S. Dlrs earned from exports, shipping and insurance and bank lending plus remittances of more than 10,000 dlrs from any other source. Petitioners have to show their remittances relate to genuine commercial transactions. Meanwhile, traders are no longer required to report all outward payments concerning invisible trade, including freight, insurance and royalties, to the central bank. But bankers said they believed the new controls would be ineffective since businessmen could split up remittances into smaller units or simply remit money through Taiwan's flourishing currency black market. The bankers said the controls, announced on March 6, are a panic reaction to U.S. Pressure, which has intensified over the past week, for a faster appreciation of the Taiwan dollar to slow the growth of Taiwan's exports to the U.S. The government has denied local press reports Washington is pressing for an exchange rate of up to 28 dlrs. The Taiwan dollar opened four cents up today at 34.70. ""I don't think the central bank has a final target,"" said an executive with a U.S. Bank. Other bankers and economists said they are wary of making any firm predictions about how far the Taiwan dollar will rise. Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. Hit 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs last year against 10.2 billion in 1985. The surplus widened in the first two months of the year to 2.35 billion dlrs from 1.87 billion in the same period last year. Economists estimate up to five billion dlrs in speculative money flowed into Taiwan in 1986. This inflow helped boost foreign exchange reserves to more than 51 billion dlrs from just under 25 billion this time last year and provided further upward pressure on the currency. The Taiwan dollar has appreciated by almost 15 pct against the U.S. Currency since September 1985, further encouraging speculators. Central bank governor Chang Chi-cheng said last week Washington's pressure plus rising foreign exchange reserves meant a further strengthening in the currency is inevitable. Many local bankers argue the only effective solution to the currency problem is to drop foreign exchange controls and allow the local dollar to find its own level. ""Lifting exchange controls is the final answer, but the central bank is not prepared to do it. It simply does not want to take the risk,"" said one local banker. He said he believed the new restrictions are a temporary measure designed to buy time as the central bank grapples with the exchange rate problem. The restrictions are a bureaucratic imposition and skirt around the real issue, he said. Taiwan needs a fundamental restructuring of foreign exchange controls, said an executive with a western bank. ""The controls will create more paperwork, but the extra bank charges will not outweigh the profits of speculation,"" said the manager of a European bank. Economists criticised the controls, saying they could antagonise Washington, which is pushing for further economic liberalisation in Taiwan. ""Instead of liberalising outflows, the government has restricted inflows,"" said Kate Newman, an economist with Vickers da Costa. A local banker, who declined to be named, said, ""It's basically ridiculous. It's a backward movement and goes against the government's liberalisation programme."" Taiwan last year eased some of its financial regulations to enable Taiwan nationals to invest in foreign government bonds, treasury bills and certificates of deposit and to allow individuals to take 5,000 U.S. Dlrs in cash out of the country each year."
australia expects rise in meat exports to mideast,carcass livestock,"Australia expects meat and livestock exports to the Middle East to maintain an upward trend this year, managing director of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corp, Peter Frawley, said. He told Reuters an improvement in the economic climate and less competition from the European Community should lead in the Gulf area to higher beef sales, which dropped from 33,000 tonnes in 1980 to just 2,300 tonnes last year. ""In the last three to four months there has been a resurgence of inquiries,"" he said. Frawley is on a Gulf tour which will also take him to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait to assess market potential. On beef exports, he said a 50 pct drop in European Community intervention stock in the past 12 months would help Australian sales. The fall meant the EC was not as aggressive in these markets, where the Australian trade was the natural source of supply, and Australia was ""now back in,"" Frawley said. He said there was a debate in Australia as to whether the Middle East market for livestock, which accounts for two-thirds of meat export value to the area, would be maintained. He believed the trade would remain with a continuing demand for fresh meat. The number of live sheep shipped last year to Saudi Arabia, the biggest single market, was 3,214,159 compared with 2,939,226 in 1985. The numbers shipped to the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain fell, however. Frawley said the slackening in demand in the Gulf had been offset by other Arab countries around the Mediterranean. Other than livestock, Australia's overall meat sales to the Middle East rose to 72,374 tonnes in 1986 from 52,403 tonnes the previous year, largely due to the sale of 25,790 tonnes of mutton and lamb to Iran. Australia sold 9,824 tonnes to Iran in 1985 after being virtually excluded by New Zealand competition for several years. Frawley said the 1986 sale contract had included a barter provision, but Iran had paid in full in cash. Negotiations with the Iranians for 1987 shipments were currently under way, with Iran again seeking credit and barter provisions, he said. Frawley said there had been a tremendous growth in demand for chilled lamb in the last four to five years and he predicted this would continue. ""The Middle East, and the Gulf in particular, is now Australia's largest market for lamb, chilled and flown in. Australia is in an ideal position to provide the supplies if the market is willing to pay a premium for a fresh, young product,"" he said."

japan firm plans to sell u.s. farmland to japanese,grain corn rice oilseed soybean orange,"A Japanese real estate company said it will launch a campaign to sell land in U.S. Farming areas to rich Japanese. Higashi Nippon House said it would offer around 2,200 acres of land in Illinois, California, Florida and Indiana from early April to gauge response. It set up International Farm Corp of America in Chicago last September to oversee the operation. American farmers would continue as working tenants and part of the profits from harvests of rice, corn, soybean and oranges would go to the Japanese investors as rental. Japanese Agriculture Ministry officials told Reuters sales were limited to farmers to keep land in agricultural use. ""Two years ago, I began to seek my own farmland in Japan,"" said Isao Nakamura, president of Higashi Nippon. ""However, sale of Japanese farmland is strictly controlled by the government, so I began to look for the land in the U.S to make my dream to own farm land come true."" Nakamura said hundreds of companies exist in the U.S. To sell farmland to investors as more and more farmers face difficulties due to the recession in U.S. Agriculture."

"jacobs suchard sees 100,000 tonne cocoa surplus",cocoa coffee,"Jacobs Suchard AG expects a world cocoa surplus of around 100,000 tonnes in 1987 compared with a 104,000 tonne surplus in 1986, Jens Sroka, head of commodity buying, told a news conference. The company expects prices to remain at around current levels despite the likelihood of agreement on buffer stock rules at the forthcoming London cocoa talks, and believes market intervention by the buffer stock manager would stabilise prices. Sroka said world coffee prices are expected to remain weak if any international coffee talks fail to produce agreement. Sroka said stagnating consumption and slight overproduction will continue to weigh on coffee prices and he forecast a continued build-up in stocks. The recent failure of the London coffee talks had surprised market observers. Unless reason prevails and the major producers return to the conference table, the world coffee market will remain free and the consequences for some producers dependant on coffee for their foreign exchange earnings would be catastrophic, Sroka added."
baldrige opposes japanese purchase of firm,acq trade,"Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige has asked the White House to consider blocking the planned Japanese acquisition of a major U.S. supercomputer and semiconductor manufacturer for national security reasons, U.S. officials said. The officials, who asked not to be named, said yesterday that Baldrige has ""serious concerns"" about the sale of Fairchild Semiconductor Corp. to Fujitsu Ltd., another major electronics firm. The officials told Reuters that if the sale went through it could leave the U.S. military overly dependent on a foreign /ompany for vital high technology equipment used in its advanced missiles, aircraft electronics and intelligence gathering. In addition, they said, the sale would also worsen the already strained trade relations between the U.S. and Japan stemming from the huge Japanese surplus. The White House Economic Policy Council would consider the sale in the coming weeks, they said. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger's position was not immediately known but in the past he has opposed the transfer of high technology to foreign governments and companies. Supercomputers made by Fairchild and other U.S. manufacturers are widely used throughout the world, but none have been sold to the Japanese government or to Japanese government-run agencies and universities."

phillips <p> to emphasize cash flow to pare debt,earn crude nat-gas,"Phillips Petroleum Co will emphasize improving its short-term cash flow this year to pare its debt, C.J. ""Pete"" Silas, chairman, told Reuters in an interview. ""Our priority is to get cash flow increased from the assets already installed,"" he said, but he declined to estimate annual cash flow for 1987. Analysts estimate Phillips"" cash flow at over one billion dlrs for 1987, while long term debt, which resulted from restructuring to find off corporate raiders in 1985, hovers about 5.9 billion dlrs as of December 1986. Silas said Phillips hope to achieve its goal by raising the capital expenditures budget to develop its oil and gas properties. ""We plan to develop the properties with short-term high cash flow prospects,"" he said. He projected a capital expenditure budget of 730 mln dlrs, up from the 1986 expenditure of 655 mln dlrs. Nearly half of that will be spent on exploration and production, and most of that will be spend overseas, Silas said. ""Phillips' top priority in 1987 will be to get the waterflooding in Norway and jack up the (Ekofisk) oil fields to improve our ability to extract oil and increase earnings,"" Silas said. Phillips estimates that the project, which is expected to cost 1.5 billion dlrs, will increase recovery by 170 mln gross barrels of oil over a period of 24 years. Phillips is also pursue opportunities in China where Silas said he was seeking ""a modification of terms with the Chinese government to make oil discoveries (in the offshore Xijang fields) commercially viable."" In the U.S. Silas said Phillips hopes to get the Point Arguello, Calif., field started up by the fourth quarter. ""We expect to start up the first platform then,"" Silas said. But emphasis on short-term cash flow has also forced the company to part with several oil and gas assets. Phillips sold its interests in the T-Block in the U.K. North Sea and U.S. reserves totaling about 1.3 billion dlrs in 1986 as part of a two billion dlrs asset sales program that is now completed, Silas said. ""We sold high cost producing assets. They were not good value for us but possibly so for someone else,"" Silas said. Silas said the 1986 assets sales will not affect earnings for the company. ""Everything we are doing is to manage our cash flow and we are using that to manage our debt. Even the asset sales, while regrettable, were necessary to reduce debt,"" Silas said. He said no asset sales are planned this year as long as oil prices don't fall sharply lower and stay at lower levels for several months. ""Then, everyone would be looking at sales (of assets), and we're no different from the others,"" Silas said. In other areas, Silas looks for improved earnings from Phillips chemical operations, which provided 299 mln dlrs in earnings for 1986, up from 219 mln dlrs in 1985. ""This was our second best year pushed by a good supply and demand balance for products, low feedstocks and energy costs for our operations,"" Silas said, ""In 1987 we think the market's supply and demand balance will be just as good but feedstock and energy costs will rise due to price recovery."""

Private traders protested last year that EPAC was being permitted to take part in tenders open to them for the first liberalised 20 pct share of the country's annual import needs. The grain and oilseed importers association ACICO opened legal proceedings to stop EPAC participating in the public tenders. Miguel Ascensao of ACICO told Reuters that Lisbon's civil court, in a preliminary ruling, had decided EPAC should not be allowed to take part in tenders open to private traders. Trade sources said the ruling, though effective immediately, was subject to appeal and would have to be confirmed in further proceedings. A member of the government Cereals Market Commission said that, as a result of the court's decision, the Commission would not be able to accept offers from EPAC in a public tender being held today for the import of 80,000 tonnes of corn. Ascensao said the court ruling stated that EPAC's participation in the public tenders violated the clauses of Portugal's EC accession treaty dealing with the gradual dismantling of the state agency's import monopoly. It also said the participation of EPAC, which still controls the national grain storage and distribution network, was unfair competition to the private traders. Traders said they believed the EC's Executive Commission was unlikely to get involved in the dispute, preferring to leave the case to be resolved as an internal Portuguese issue. ""They (the EC Commission) will be keeping a low profile,"" one trader said. ACICO says it is ready to take its case to Brussels if necessary."
magma <mgcpv> sees profitable copper production,earn copper,"Newmont Mining Corp <NEM> said Magma Copper Co anticipates being able to produce copper at a profit by 1991, assuming copper prices remain at their current levels. In an information statement distributed to Newmont shareholders explaining the dividend of Magma shares declared Tuesday, Newmont said Magma had a net loss of 46.6 mln dlrs in 1986, adding this was equal to 1.22 cts a share. Newmont holders will receive 80 pct of Magma's stock as a dividend of one share for each of the 30,458,000 Newmont shares now held. Newmont will retain 15 pct of the stock. The 1986 net loss was on a pro forma basis, Newmont said. On a historical basis, it added, Magma had a 1986 net loss of 58.1 mln dlrs on a loss from operations of 42.3 mln dlrs. On Dec 31, 1986, Newmont said, Magma had about 85.0 mln dlrs of net operating loss carryforwards expiring in 1999-2000 and about 4.0 mln dlrs of investment tax credit carryover expiring in 2000-2001. Newmont said Magma has pre-tax losses of 290 mln dlrs during the 1981 through 1985 period, noting the five major U.S. primary copper producers reported aggregate pre-tax losses of 1.9 billion dlrs during five year period. Newmont said Magma had total sales of 347.3 mln dlrs last year, including copper sales of 293.4 mln dlrs. It said the copper sales value was up from 267.6 mln dlrs in 1985 reflecting a 10.1 pct increase in quantity sold to 212,000 short tons and a 0.4 pct decrease in price."

u.s. to ask for share of japan's rice market,grain rice,"U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said he will ask Japan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. exporters when he visits that country next month. In an interview with Reuters, Lyng also said the Reagan administration will ask Tokyo to remove its quotas on U.S. beef and citrus exports. Lyng, who plans to be in Japan April 14-27, said he will not ask Tokyo to liberalize fully its rice market. ""We will urge that they consider sharing their rice market,"" he said. The USDA secretary would not say how big a share of the Japanese rice market the U.S. would request. ""We've got none of it now. If we got one per cent of it, it would be a big improvement,"" he said. Last year, the Reagan administration rejected a petition by the U.S. rice industry seeking relief from Japanese import restrictions. However, the U.S. said it would reexamine the issue if by mid-1987 Japan did not roll back import barriers to U.S. rice exports. Lyng said he would not be conducting formal negotiations next month with Japan over their beef and citrus quotas, but that his visit ""may be a forerunner in a general way"" to talks prior to expiration of the bilateral agreement in March 1988. He said, however, that the U.S. ""will ask for a definite liberalization of those items (beef and citrus).... When you translate 'liberalization' into Japanese, it means do away with the quota."""
union pacific <unp> to sell part of refinery,acq crude,"Union Pacific Corp said it will sign a pact in Caracas on March 17 with Petroleos De Venezuela, PDVSA, to sell the state owned company half of its Corpus Christi, Texas refinery owned by its Union Pacific's Champlin Petroleum Co subsidiary. The sale will also include the related marketing and distribution system for the refinery's products. A spokesman for the company said that a statement may be issued later today giving details of the transaction. There was no immediate comment from PDVSA officials in New York. The Corpus Christi refinery has a capacity of about 160,000 barrels per day, the Union Pacific spokesman said, and is a largely upgraded facility but he would place no value on the transaction. The additional acquisition of refinery and distribution assets by PDVSA has been expected as Venezuela has been moving aggressively to enhance its role in the oil industry from producer to excpanding its presence in the downstream sector. Purchase of part of Champlin's operations also fits a profile which PDVSA officials have said previously they looked for in any acquisition. One PDVSA official said the company was looking for independent oil companies with good refinery and distribution network and a strong regional presence. The potential purchase of the interest in Champlin followed its earlier acquisition of a part interest in Southland Corp's <SLC> Citgo Petroleum Corp subsidiary. In that agreement signed September 15, 1986, PDVSA paid Southland 290 mln dlrs for half of Citgo's stock. The potetnital acquisition of half Champlin's Corpus Christi plant will also give Venezuela an additional outlet for its crude oil production while giving the refiner an assured source of supply, trade sources said. In the earlier deal with Southland, PDVSA agredd to to supply Citgo with at least 130,000 bpd of crude oil and other feedstocks."
lyng says no decision on soviet eep offer,grain wheat,"U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said the Reagan administration had not decided on offering the Soviet Union subsidized wheat but that such an offer had not been ruled out. In an interview with Reuters, Lyng also said that he had no knowledge of any upcoming discussion of the matter within the cabinet. Asked if the administration had ruled out offering to subsidize wheat exports to the Soviet Union under the department's export enhancement program, Lyng said, ""No. We haven't made a decision on it, haven't even talked about it, haven't even looked at it."" Reminded that there have been reports that Moscow would buy U.S. wheat if competitively priced, Lyng responded, ""If they (the Soviets) would offer to buy some wheat, would we accept it? It would depend on what price they offered."" Lyng added that he did not think the price of U.S. wheat was far off the world price. Asked about persistent speculation that the administration would offer Moscow a wheat subsidy, Lyng said, ""Some people think they're doing it to see if they can get a little spurt in the market."" Agriculture Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz last week asked the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to investigate reports that wheat prices were being manipulated by reports that a U.S. wheat subsidy offer was imminent."
union pacific <unp> in partnership with pdvsa,crude acq,"Union Pacific Corp said it will enter a 50-50 partnership with Petroles de Venezuela, PDVSA, to own and operate Union Pacific's 160,000 barrel-per-day Corpus Christi, Texas, oil refinery. The assests to be acquired by the partnership are valued at 190 mln dlrs, Union Pacific said. Closing is expected to take place in early April and the venture is to be called Champlin Refining Co. The partnership will acquire the refining and distribution systems currently owned and operated by Champlin Petroleum, a wholly owned subsidiary of Union Pacific. The venture will acquire the related inventories and the Champlin trade name, the company said. PDVSA and Union Pacific will each contribute half the capital required by the venture and arrange a revolving credit facility with U.S. and foreign banks to finance inventories and receivables, Union Pacific said. Petroles de Venezuela also signed a 25-year agreement to supply at least 140,000 bpd of Venezulean crude oil and naphtha to the refinery at market related prices. Under various options the in the agreement PDVSA could supply another 50,000 bpd on similar terms, the company said. ""This will provide a stable, long-term supply to the refinery at competitive costs, thereby assuring the economic viability of the plant,"" a statement issued by Union Pacific said. The statement said the agreement with PDVSA will enable the company to supply a steady flow of refined products to its customers. Union Pacific said employees of the refinery would be transfered to the new company and would retain the same benefits as in the past."
u.s.-soviet grain accord questioned by lyng,grain corn wheat,"U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said he was not sure a long-term U.S.-Soviet grain agreement would be worth extending when it expires next year. ""It hasn't been worth much in the last two years....They haven't lived up to the agreement as I see it,"" Lyng said in an interview with Reuters. ""It would be my thought that it's not worth any effort to work out an agreement with someone who wants the agreement to be a one-sided thing,"" he said. However, Lyng said he did not want to make a ""definitive commitment one way or another at this point."" Under the accord covering 1983-88, the Soviets agreed to buy at least nine mln tonnes of U.S. grain, including four mln tonnes each of corn and wheat. Moscow bought 6.8 mln tonnes of corn and 153,000 tonnes of wheat during the third agreement year, which ended last September, and this year has bought one mln tonnes of corn. Lyng said he had no knowledge of how much U.S. grain Moscow would buy this year. ""I've seen people making comments on that and I don't know how they know, unless they talk to the Soviets,"" he said. ""I have no knowledge, and I really don't think anyone other than the Soviets have any knowledge."" Lyng said he thought the Soviets bought U.S. corn last month because ""they needed it and because the price was right."" ""Our corn has been pretty reasonably priced. And I think they've always found that our corn was good,"" he said."
u.s. soybean marketing loan not needed - lyng,oilseed soybean,"U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said a marketing loan for soybeans would serve no present purpose because the U.S. price is not above the world price. Asked in an interview if it was time to consider a marketing loan for soybeans, Lyng said, ""I don't think so. I don't think the world price is lower than our price anyway."" However, the USDA secretary said that if current conditions of surplus production persisted, it might be appropriate to consider a marketing loan. ""I suppose that under that condition there is a danger our exports will continue to drop and that the government will continue to accumulate large stocks of soybeans,"" he said. ""It might be (worth contemplating a marketing loan), if there were a world market that was lower than our market."""
u.s. seismic crew count drops 6 pct in february,crude nat-gas,"The number of seismic crews searching for oil and gas in the United States dropped by nine to a total of 151 crews, a decrease of six pct from January, the Society of Exploration Geophysicists said. The February total represented a 49 pct decrease from February 1986. Worldwide, the association's monthly survey showed that seismic exploration for oil and gas increased to 395 in February, up three from the month before. Africa added three seismic crews, the Middle East increased by two and the Far East added one while reductions were reported in Central and South America, Europe and the United States."
usda says wheat purchased from foreign sellers,grain wheat,"The U.S. Agriculture Department said private U.S. exporters reported purchases from foreign sellers of 120,000 tonnes of wheat for delivery to unknown destinations. The wheat, consisting of 60,000 tonnes of hard red winter and 60,000 tones of soft red winter, is for delivery during the 1987/88 season, which begins June 1. A purchase from a foreign seller is a transaction in which a U.S. exporter contracts to buy U.S.-produced commodities from a foreign firm, the department said."
glickman pushes hard for 0/92 farm plan,grain wheat corn oilseed soybean,"Implementation of a one-year 0/92 pilot program for wheat and feedgrains was strongly promoted today by the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee as a way to cut farm costs and simultaneously give farmers another option when making their planting decisions. ""We have a budget driven farm policy. It may be a shame, but we are locked into this,"" said Dan Glickman, (D-Kans.), chairman of the subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed grains. ""We need to look at ways to cut costs and not hurt the farmer. A 0/92 plan, if properly done, could do both."" Glickman announced this week plans to introduce a 0/92 bill for 1987 and 1988 wheat and feedgrains. An aide to Glickman said that it will probably be introduced next week. Glickman said a 0/92 program, which allows a farmer to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiency payment, would not be a major revision of the 1985 farm bill -- only an extension of the 50/92 option already provided under the current bill. It is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill, he said, but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meet budget goals, a voluntary 0/92 plan would be better than sharply cutting target prices, as USDA has proposed. A 0/92 plan, however, would not be decoupling, but simply a different type of acreage diversion program, Glickman said. Decoupling -- delinking planting decisions from government payments -- is too much of a policy change to approve at this point, he said. ""I don't think there is any interest in pursuing a decoupling bill this year. Period. Unequivocal,"" Glickman said at the hearing. Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.), cosponsor of the Boren/Boschwitz decoupling plan, said he supports a short term 0/92 program as a move to a more permament decoupling plan. Boschwitz plans to introduce a 0/92 plan in the senate. His plan would guarantee a certain deficiency payment to participating farmers, require that idled acreage be put to conservation use only, prohibit haying and grazing on extra idled acreage, limit participation to a certain number of acres in a county and provide tenant protection provisions. ""I know we cannot obtain complete decoupling in 1987, but we can at least move in that direction,"" Boschwitz said. Robbin Johnson, vice president of Cargill, Inc., testified in favor of decoupling. Decoupling would end the current bias in U.S. farm policy towards overproduction and reduce farmers' dependency on the government, he said. A 0/92 plan does not go far enough in decoupling, Johnson said, and would still encourage farmers to plant. Officials from the National Corn Growers Association and the National Cattlemen's Association said their groups oppose any 0/92 or decoupling plan due to concerns about reopening the farm bill and creating more confusion among farmers. But when asked if his association were forced to choose between a ten pct cut in target prices or a 0/92 program, Larry Johnson of the Corn Growers said they would agree to 0/92 rather than take sharp cuts in target levels."

bolivia to offer to buy back bank debt,gnp cpi reserves,"Bolivia is to make a formal offer during the next few months to buy back its 900 mln dlrs debt from commercial banks at a discount of up to 90 pct, central bank president Jier Nogales said. Nogales told Reuters in an interview the steering committee of Bolivia's creditor banks had agreed to consider the offer at a meeting in New York last month. He said the offer would be based on the value of Bolivian paper on the international secondary debt market, where it now trades at between 10 and 15 pct of its face value. Nogales said Bolivia will make a single offer to buy back its commercial debt and banks who accepted would be paid the discounted rate in full. Banks which declined the offer would be repaid over 20 to 30 years at interest rates below those fixed in the international markets, he added. Bolivia has frozen payments on medium and long term loans to commercial banks since March, 1984, and Nogales said there would be no money available to restart traditional debt servicing to them for some time. Several Latin American countries have initiated schemes to cancel foreign debt by equity swaps or third party buy-backs, but Bolivia would be the first country in the region to make a formal offer to buy back all its commercial bank debt at discounted rates. Nogales said practical and strategic considerations would determine the exact timing of the offer but it would be made in the next few months. He said Bolivia would not bargain with creditor banks over the price to paid for the debt paper they hold, and would make a single non-negotiable offer. He said Bolivia could not even pay interest to friendly creditor countries, let alone commercial banks. The only traditional way forward was to capitalise interest, which would mean greater bank exposure in Bolivia and greater loss provisions, he added. ""We are confident that the banks are going to be reasonable,"" Nogales said. ""Now they can resolve their problems for once and for all."" ""The most conservative ones who want a little more will wait a year, but I don't know if the window of opportunity will be open all the time,"" he added. Discussing the status of other parts of Bolivia's four billion dlr foreign debt, 2.5 billion of which is owed to governments and the rest to international agencies, Nogales said negotiators had achieved considerable success in recent discussions with the Paris Club. He said Paris Club creditors had agreed to reschedule Bolivian debt over 10 years with five to six years grace, while accepting that interest would not be paid until 1989. Interest rates were being discussed on a bilateral basis under Paris Club rules, he added. He said some Paris Club members had agreed to disregard penalty interest payments and negotiations were continuing with Argentina and Brazil, who hold 700 mln dlrs of Bolivian debt. He said Bolivia was continuing to service loans from international agencies, and it expected to receive up to 400 mln dlrs in disbursements this year. The capital flow for loans and their servicing had changed from a negative balance of 250 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net inflow of 130 mln dlrs last year, he added. Nogales said that Bolivia's net international reserves now stood at around 250 mln dlrs, compared to one mln dlrs in disposable funds when the government of Victor Paz Estenssoro took office in August, 1985. Nogales said inflation, which soared to over 20,000 pct a year in the government's first month in office, was now down to 10 pct on an annualised basis from the last six months, and the plan was that it should continue at this level. He said the government was also expecting at least three pct growth in gdp this year after several years of negative rates."
u.s. market loan not that attractive-boschwitz,grain wheat oilseed soybean cotton rice,"A marketing loan for U.S. wheat, feedgrains and soybeans would do nothing to help the surplus production situation and would be extremely costly, Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.) said. ""I think I would not support a marketing loan now,"" he told the House agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains. Boschwitz was one of the original supporters of a marketing loan for cotton and rice, but has since focused support on decoupling legislation, the Boren/Boschwitiz bill. A market loan for grains and soybeans would encourage more production, especially in high-yielding areas, would be much more expensive than the current cotton and rice marketing loans and not increase exports significantly, he said."
live cattle rally as lockout at meat plant ends,l-cattle livestock,"Live cattle futures posted a robust rally today after a major beef packing company said it would end a lockout at its slaughtering plant in Dakota City, Neb. April delivery cattle on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange closed at 64.45 cents a pound, up 0.83 cent, as the market expected demand for live animals to increase as the plant restarts operations. Iowa Beef Processors, a division of Occidental Petroleum, said it planned to reopen the plant, one of the largest in the nation, on March 16. The plant has been closed since Dec. 14, the day after a contract between IBP and Local 222 of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union expired. The plant employs 2,800 workers and can slaughter several thousand animals a day, a company spokesman said. The company said it locked out union workers because they threatened to disrupt operations. It was unclear whether union meatpackers would return to work. They rejected the company's latest contract offer March 5. Traders said cattle prices advanced at midsession as rumors circulated that the lockout was ending, and gains were further fueled by a noticeable increase in demand for live animals on cash markets in Nebraska and the Texas Panhandle. The rally in cattle also boosted values of live hogs and frozen pork bellies, which also were supported by indications that producers were expanding their hog herds at a slower rate than previously expected. Petroleum futures posted a modest rally on the New York Mercantile Exchange. But a report that the Soviet Union planned to reduce the price of its crude oil exports may pressure the market Friday, said Nauman Barakat, petroleum analyst in New York with Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. Buying by companies that deal in petroleum helped prices recover from early weakness, traders said. Gold futures rallied, partly in response to strength in the silver market, on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Silver prices rallied after a U.S. brokerage house recommended its customers buy the metal, traders said. Coffee futures drifted lower in response to a report that Colombia lowered the price of its exports, traders said. Sugar prices closed slightly higher on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange despite a large export sale by the European Commission on Wednesday. Soybeans were higher, wheat lower and corn mixed on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans were boosted by expectations that the Agriculture Department would report a healthy signup for the Conservation Reserve Program, which pays farmers to leave highly erodible land idle instead of planting a crop, traders said. Concern that a strike by Brazilian seamen might interrupt exports of soybeans from Brazil, where the harvest is just beginning, also underpinned prices, they said. Wheat prices were pressured by selling in response to trends on price charts, they said."

This compares with yearend 1985 proved reserves estimates of 26.4 mln barrels of oil and 78.6 mln MCF of gas, Permian said. Permian said December 1986 future net revenues from proved reserves were 335.6 mln dlrs, down from 814.2 mln dlrs in 1985. Permian said the present value of estimated future net revenues discounted at 10 pct is 165.3 mln dlrs, compared with 374.3 mln dlrs. It said the downward revisions in both proved reserves and estimated future net revenues resulted from decreased prices for oil and gas."
venezuelan president defends refinancing accord,gnp cpi,"president jaime lusinchi defended the 20.3 billion dlr debt rescheduling accord his government recently signed, saying it will open new credit flows and bring needed foreign investment to venezuela. In his annual state of the nation speech, lusinchi also said venezuela supports other latin american debtors, despite having reached a rescheduling accord on its own. In the 90-minute speech to the congress, lusinchi summed up the achievements of his administration, which took office in february 1984. He pointed to the 3.3 pct growth in non-oil gdp in 1986 and to a ""moderate"" 12 pct inflation rate. Lusinchi said the 20.3 billion dlr debt rescheduling signed feb. 27 put an end to a process which had been 'the calvary of our nation over the post four years.' In the refinancing accord, he said, venezuela managed to achieve 'the most inmportant thing, which is the reopening of financial flows from abroad, essential for the financing of development and the (financing) of trade and investment.' Once all the details of the agreement are finalized, he said, venezuela will seek new financing for the imported components of new development projects. ""our intention is not to continue being net exporters of capital, but to protect our balance of payments with a flow of capital towards venezuela,"" he said. Under the agreement signed february 27, venezuela extended payments on the debt from 12 to 14 years, while the interest rate was lowered from 1 y 1/8 to 7/8 of a pct over libor. At the same time, payments over the next three years were lowered from 3.450 to 1.350 billion dlrs. Lusinchi defended the rescheduling accord against critics who said it merely deferred the weight of payments to future governments."

fed data indicate no policy change likely,money-supply interest,"U.S. bank reserve, monetary and discount window borrowings data released by the Federal Reserve today clearly indicate that policy is ""on hold"" and may not be changed for weeks or even months, economists said. ""The Fed is keeping policy at dead center and it is not about to change policy unless something fairly dramatic occurs on the economy,"" said John Williams of Bankers Trust Co. ""These numbers contain no hint that a policy shift is in prospect, nor do economic or financial developments argue for policy change,"" said William Griggs of Griggs and Santow Inc. Fed data released today were all in line with economists' expectations and similar to the numbers of recent weeks. The Fed said net discount window borrowings in the two weeks ended Wednesday averaged 191 mln dlrs, up from 381 mln dlrs in the February 25 statement period, but little changed from 160 mln dlrs in the period before that. It said that banks' net free reserves in the latest two weeks averaged 660 mln dlrs versus 675 mln dlrs previously. Finally, the Fed said that the M-1 money supply fell 800 mln dlrs in February, with the broader M-2 measure down 1.6 billion dlrs and M-3 up an even three billion dlrs. Analysts said that M-1 last month grew at a negative 1.3 pct annual rate compared with minus 0.7 pct for M-2 and actual positive growth of 1.0 pct annualized for M-3. February levels of M-2 and M-3 left the aggregates 18.2 and 20.8 billion dlrs under their respective upper growth limits set by the Fed for 1987. The annual growth target for both is 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct. There is no M-1 target. ""In the near term, there is absolutely no reason for the Fed to ease policy, even apart from the slowdown in money growth,"" said Stephen Slifer, economist at Lehman Government Securities Inc. Economists generally expect a modest pickup in monetary growth in March after February's anemic growth rates. However, they stress that money growth will not be strong enough to prevent the Fed from dropping interest rates further if the economy shows evidence of weakness. Commenting on February's decline in the key M-2 aggregate, Slifer said the main cause was a 3.2 billion dlr drop in money market deposits at banks. This number has risen three to four billion dlrs a month for a long while, he said, so February's weakness is not likely to persist. Slifer expects modest M-2 and M-3 growth rates of 3-1/2 to four pct during March. Griggs said that M-2 and M-3 in coming months should return to the five to seven pct annualized growth region and so continue to present no problem for the Fed. Economists said the Fed appears to be very comfortable with its current policy stance and it is likely to wait for perhaps several more months of economic data before deciding whether or not to ease its grip on reserves. Given the economy's fragility in many sectors, the analysts agreed that there is almost no chance that the Fed will choose to raise, rather than lower, interest rates when it next changes policy. ""Discount window borrowings in the past week were about as low as the Fed can get them, although Fed funds held above six pct,"" said Williams of Bankers Trust. Funds averaged 6.12 pct in the week to Wednesday, up from 6.06 pct in the prior week. The Fed added reserves indirectly via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements last Friday, 2.5 billion dlrs on Monday and two billion dlrs on Wednesday. On Tuesday, it added reserves directly through two-day System repurchases. Williams and Griggs agreed the Fed will let the funds rate be largely market-driven. They said it is focusing instead on a borrowings target of around 300 mln dlrs."

australian terms of trade worsen in last quarter,trade bop,"Australia's terms of trade fell by a further 3.5 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 after declining 0.8 pct in the third quarter and 2.7 pct a year earlier, the Statistics Bureau said. It said the seasonally adjusted current account deficit of 3.22 billion dlrs in the quarter would have dropped to 912 mln if not for the terms of trade decline. The fourth quarter decline followed a 1.1 pct fall in export prices and a 2.4 pct rise in import prices, it said. The Bureau noted Australia's terms of trade had fallen by 19.9 pct since the fourth quarter of 1983."

australian beef output seen declining in 1987,livestock carcass,"Australian beef output is forecast to decline to 1.34 mln tonnes carcass weight in 1987 and 1.36 mln in 1988 from 1.44 mln in 1986, the Australian Meat and Live-Stock Corp (AMLC) said. Exports of beef/veal are also predicted to decline to 480,000 tonnes shipped weight in 1987 from 515,000 in 1986, and then rally to 490,000 in 1988, the AMLC said in a summary of its bi-annual meat and livestock forecasts. It sees cattle numbers remaining at around the 1986 level of 23.2 mln beasts in both years because herd rebuilding is expected to be slower than previously forecast. Beef producers are becoming more confident that higher returns in the market, both domestically and overseas, will continue, the AMLC said. The slow herd build-up and the forecast lower production is expected to bring about a slight drop in both export and domestic consumption this year, it said. The forecast does not assume a turnaround in production levels until late next year. It said the outlook for beef exports as a proportion of output remains much the same as last year when it was around 55 pct of total production. In 1985 it was 52 pct. The increase in exports of beef as a percentage of production has mainly been attributed to the decline in the Australian dollar, the AMLC said. It also forecast that Australia's four major markets, the U.S., Japan, Canada and Taiwan, will continue to dominate the chilled and frozen beef export markets. They take collectively around 94 pct of total Australian exports."

Gulf cash barge basis levels jumped two to three cents this morning on the rumors, which were expected to boost futures prices on today's open. The Soviet Union recently bought over 1.0 mln tonnes of U.S. corn, ostensibly as a conciliatory gesture ahead of trade talks with U.S. agriculture officials. Purchases rumored today were seen as a positive factor in light of a Soviet trade official's statement that the previous purchase had satisfied near-term needs."

Asked about the future of the dollar, he said that whether or not it would rise or fall depended on economic policies and coooperation among trading nations. Yeutter said ""if nations do the right kinds of things in financial, monetary and tax policies, then a lesser burden of adjustment is placed on exchange rates, and one could envision a situation of the major trading nations moving back far closer to what most of us would consider equilibrium and exchange rates becoming relatively stable."" But he said, on the other hand, that if nations did not exhibit greater self discipline and international cooperation, ""It is simply inevitable that the exchange rates will make that adjustment."""
u.s. conservation signup seen 10 to 12 mln acres,grain corn,"Grain traders and analysts look for a 10 to 12 mln acre sign-up in the USDA's conservation reserve program, scheduled to be announced after 1400 CST today. The USDA probably will accept about 80 to 90 pct of the acres submitted, they said. Total enrollment in the first three years of the program is only 8.9 mln acres, so the sharp increase expected this year has underpinned new crop corn futures all week. However, some analysts said a 10 to 12 mln acre sign-up may end up being negative to new crop corn prices, citing trade talk earlier this year that 14 to 15 mln acres may be submitted by farmers. Also, acres set-aside under the conservation program are by definition poor yielding, so the impact on total corn production will be minimal, they added."
ussr heavy buyers of yugoslav corn-u.s. report,grain corn,"The Soviet Union has been a heavy buyer of Yugoslav corn since October, purchasing close to 1.5 mln tonnes in the 1986/87 marketing year, according to a report from the U.S. agriculture counselor in Belgrade. Approximately 1.5 mln tonnes of Yugoslav corn have already been committed to foreign buyers for 1986/87, with most of this sold to the Soviet Union, the Yugoslav Grain Association reported to the U.S. official. In a report dated March 10, the official said that about 800,000 tonnes of the corn has been delivered, with the balance of 700,000 tonnes to be shipped between now and June. An additional 500,000 tonnes of corn can be shipped from July-September, the grain associaiton said, so total Yugoslav corn exports could reach 2.0 mln tonnes, the counselor said. Heavier than normal monthly shipping rates for Yugoslav corn exports are due to the increased use of river barges for exporting corn to the Soviet Union, the counselor said. Monthly corn shipments out of Yugoslavia have averaged around 160,000 tonnes since October 1, higher than earlier estimates of 150,000, the official said. The Soviet Union has taken an increased share of Yugoslav corn sales during this marketing year, he said."
fed seen content with u.s. february economy,interest gnp ipi wpi,"U.S. February reports reflecting slim gains in industrial output and moderating inflation pressures reinforced expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue to follow a stable course of monetary policy, economists said. ""If you're the Fed, there's no reason to do anything,"" said Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities Inc. ""There are hints that GNP is picking up. On the inflation front, all is well,"" he said. ""Money supply is well under control. It's an absolutely ideal situation."" February U.S. industrial production rose 0.5 pct, slightly less than the 0.7 pct gain the financial markets had expected. This compared with a slim 0.1 pct rise in January's production number, previously reported as a 0.4 pct increase. The February U.S. producer price index gained only 0.1 pct, less than a 0.3-0.4 pct expected rise. This followed a 0.6 pct rise in the PPI in January. ""The Fed is going to look at this positively,"" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation. ""Certainly inflation is not as bad as what Volcker (Fed Chairman) has said lately. Industrial production growth is along the lines of what the Fed wants."" The energy products component of PPI rose 4.0 pct in February, after a 9.8 pct increase in January. ""This shows that the impact of energy prices on inflation is behind us in terms of the move from 15 dlrs to 18 dlrs per barrel,"" said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ""The trend is still 3.5 pct in the first half of the year."" In 1986, declining energy prices contributed to a 2.5 pct decline in the PPI. Economists said that a rise in energy prices was expected, but a sharp drop in auto prices was not. Passenger car prices fell 3.4 pct and light truck prices dropped 1.3 pct. Yesterday, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said that a possibility of renewed inflation remains a concern in both the financial markets and the Federal Reserve. ""The Fed may be lowering its own inflation expectations today,"" said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International. While low inflation permits the Fed to maintain an easier monetary policy, Brusca said if import prices do not rise this could necessitate a weaker dollar. ""The outlook for the dollar is still up in the air,"" he said. ""We need inflation for U.S. producers to compete with foreign producers."" Brusca said prices of electronic equipment dropped 0.8 pct in February's PPI. With many electronic goods produced overseas, this may show that foreign producers are not raising prices which bodes ill for U.S. competitiveness, he said. If further dollar declines are needed, this could diminish overseas investment in U.S. debt, Brusca added, which might necessitate higher interest rates and lower bond prices. By contrast, Slifer said imported goods prices rose 11.8 pct from first quarter 1985 to first quarter 1986 reflecting to a large degree a 22 pct drop in the trade-weighted real value of the dollar from February 1985 to February 1987. Slifer said import prices may rise further as manufacturers' contracts put in place before the dollar dropped to current levels expire, and new contracts are made that reflect a weaker dollar. David Wyss of Data Resources Inc noted that imported manufactured goods prices rose 8.5 pct at an annual rate in the second half of 1986, which has contributed to rising U.S. industrial output. ""It's the other side of the lower dollar,"" Wyss said. ""Producers are beginning to find themselves more competitive and they are increasing output."" Wyss said that the latest data point to an average industrial production gain of 0.3-0.4 pct in the first quarter. ""It's an encouraging sign that the manufacturing sector is beginning to revive."" But Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc was not convinced that the February reports portend economic gains. He said much of the strength came from factors that do not point to a sustained rise in industrial output. Roach pointed out that stikers returning to work in farm equipment industries helped account for a one pct rise in February business equipment production. Utilities output rose 0.7 pct in February after gaining 1.2 pct in January, but Roach said it shows mostly that more energy was produced, not that manufacturing activity gained. Finally, he pointed out that auto production accounted for half of the industrial production gain as production of auto assemblies rose to 8.3 million units at an annual rate from 7.5 million units. ""In the first quarter, it looks like automakers are producing at an 8.5 mln unit annual rate, but selling at roughly a seven mln unit rate,"" Roach said. ""The disparity between output and sales is showing up in inventories."" Economists pointed to sharp rise in January U.S. business inventories as a sign that production may be outstripping demand in the first quarter of 1987. January business inventories rose 0.9 pct, the largest gain since July 1979 when inventories rose 1.7 pct, the Commerce Department said. Business sales dropped 4.5 pct in January, the largest monthly sales drop on record. Nonetheless, economists do not expect the Fed to react to month-to-month changes. ""The Fed has been standing pat for the last seven months,"" Ramirez said. ""They will continue to stand pat for at least the next couple of months."""
mobil <mob> capital expenditures lower in 1987,crude nat-gas,"Mobil Corp chairman Allen E. Murray said in the annual report issued today that the company's total 1987 capital expenditures would be lower than the three billion dlrs spent in 1986. ""Overall capital and exploration expenditures will fall slightly below the level for 1986 although we'll be ready to increase spending whenever the outlook becomes more promising,"" Murray said. Mobil data in the annual report shows capital expenditures have been cut every year since 1984's 3.6 billion dlrs to 3.5 billion dlrs in 1985. Murray told shareholders that despite the cuts ""the company has promising acreage to explore as well as major oil and gas reserves to develop in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Africa and Indonesia. Over the past two weeks Mobil has announced restructuring of its domestic exploration and development organization and this week a restructuring of its oil services units, which support the new affiliate. ""Mobil's chairman has explained this change by saying we need a leaner organization to get more efficient usage from our assets,"" said John Lord, a Mobil Corp spokesman. Murray said in announcing the first reorganization, which will combine its current three exploration and producing affiliates into one organization, Mobil Exploration and Production U.S. Inc, that it is more effective than the present organization and will improve the company's upstream competitive position. Yesterday the company said that it will restructure its Mobil Exploration and Producing Services Inc, MEPSI, to enhance the development and transfer of technology supporting critical areas of exploration, drilling, resevoir management and computer systems. Earnings from Mobil's upstream operations in 1986 were 827 mln dlrs, down 54 pct from the previous year's 1.8 billion dlrs in earnings. Mobil's strategy in the exploration and production sector will be to give most attention to exploration possibilities with the greatest long term potential, the company said. In its annual report, Mobil said that this will include greater emphasis on ""frontier plays that, although riskier, fit our strengths of technology and size...This probably also means a shift toward emphasis in the foreign area since selective overseas exploration offers greater potential."""
brazilian troops to leave oil refineries,crude ship,"Brazil's labour troubles eased a little today as the authorities announced they were withdrawing troops from the country's main oil installations occupied three days ago. The troops went in at the request of the state-oil company Petrobras because of the threat of a strike by 55,000 oil industry employees. Petrobras said in a statement today it had requested the withdrawal of the troops. The situation in the refineries was calm, it said, and the employees had indicated their willingness to negotiate a pay deal. A national seamen's strike, however, continued and marines remained in the country's main ports. The marines were despatched to the ports after the seamen's strike, now two weeks old, was ruled illegal last Friday. A spokesman at the national strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro said today a total of l63 ships were strike-bound, 135 in Brazil and 28 in foreign ports. Yesterday two small companies specialised in the transport of chemicals, Global and Flumar, struck a pay accord with their seamen who have secured a 120 pct increase. Brazilian newspapers today hailed these agreements as a sign that the national strike could soon come to an end. Both companies employ fewer than 200 seamen and union leaders said the vast majority of Brazil's 40,000 seamen were still on strike. The threat of a stoppage by oil industry employees appeared today to be receding. Petrobras said in its statement that the company would meet union leaders for pay talks in Rio de Janeiro next Wednesday. Labour Minister Almir Pazzionotto would act as a mediator. Besides industrial troubles, there has also been considerable unrest this week in the agricultural sector. On Tuesday hundreds of thousands of farmers held rallies throughout the country to protest against high interest rates. Television reports showed some of these protests still continuing today, with farmers blockading banks with their vehicles in several towns in the states of Sao Paulo and Parana. The strikes in Brazil come as the government is trying to extricate itself from a serious debt crisis brought on by a deterioration in its trade balance. On February 20 President Jose Sarney announced that Brazil was suspending interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of debt to private banks. Because of the seamen strike exports are being delayed and the country is losing badly needed foreign exchange."
mobil <mob> adds natural gas reserves in 1986,nat-gas crude,"Mobil Corp increased net proven reserves of natural gas liquids in 1986 from the previous year according to data in its 1986 annual report. The report states that total net proved reserves at year's end stood at 2.5 billion barrels, an increase of 94 mln barrels or four pct above the previous year and detailed data show that the gains resulted from an increase in net proved reserves of natural gas liquids. Mobil said gains were in Indonesia where a sixth production facility began operation in October with a capacity to manufacture 1.7 mln tonnes of liquified natural gas. The company also said that new capacity brought onstream last year replaced 120 pct of Mobil's production, which declined by about four pct in 1986 from the previous year. Detailed data on reserves shows that U.S. net proved reserves of crude oil fell to 837 mln barrels from 853 mln barrels in 1985, natural gas liquid reserves were also lower in 1986 from the previous year. Net proved crude oil reserves also fell in Canada to 224 mln barrels and in Europe to 403 mln barrels from the previous year's level of 231 mln barrels and 439 mln barrels, respectively."
numerous factors said point to ussr corn buying,grain corn,"A greater than anticipated need, competitive prices and political motivations could be sparking Soviet interest in U.S. corn, industry and government officials said. As rumors circulated through grain markets today that the Soviet Union has purchased an additional 1.5 mln tonnes of U.S. corn, industry and government sources noted a number of factors that make Soviet buying of U.S. corn likely. First, there are supply concerns. Some trade sources said recent speculation has been that last year's Soviet grain crop be revised to only 190 mln tonnes, rather than the 210 mln announced, therby increasing the Soviet need for grain. A drop in Argentine corn crop prospects could also affect Soviet corn buying, an Agriculture Department source said. Dry weather in Argentina -- a major corn supplier to the USSR -- and reported crop problems prompted USDA to lower its Argentine 1986/87 corn crop estimate this week to 11.0 mln tonnes, down from 11.5 mln. Argentina corn exports were also cut by 500,000 tonnes to 6.8 mln tonnes. Argentina has already committed four mln tonnes of this year's corn for export, a USDA official said, with two mln tonnes of that booked for April-June delivery to the USSR. ""Significant downside potential"" still exists for the Argentine crop, the official said, which will decrease the amount of additional corn that country can sell to Moscow. ""If the Soviet needs are greater than we have been thinking, then they might need more than what Argentina can provide during the April to June period,"" he said. Current competitive prices for U.S. corn have also sparked Soviet buying. U.S. corn was reported to be selling on the world market earlier this week for around 71 dlrs per tonne, Argentine corn for 67 dlrs -- a very competitive price spread, U.S. and Soviet sources said. ""This price difference makes American corn competitive,"" Albert Melnikov, commercial counselor for the Soviet Union, told Reuters. Impending crop problems in Argentina will likely cause those prices to rise, and with the recently strong U.S. corn futures prices, the Soviets might feel corn prices have bottomed and that this is a good time to buy, sources said. Finally, some industry sources said that by buying the minimum amount of corn guaranteed under the U.S./USSR grains agreement (four mln tonnes), the Soviet Union may be hoping to convince the USDA to offer Moscow a subsidy on wheat. In an inteview with Reuters this week, USDA secretary Richard Lyng said that no decision had been made on a wheat subsidy offer, but that such an offer had not been ruled out."
usda reports 10.572 mln acres in conservation,grain corn,"The U.S. Agriculture Department has accepted 10,572,402 more acres of highly erodable cropland into the Conservation Reserve Program, USDA announced. In the latest signup, farmers on 101,020 farms submitted bids on a total of 11,254,837 acres. The accepted bids for annual rental payments ranged up to 90 dlrs per acre with an average of 51.17 dlrs per acre. Land entered into the Conservation Reserve Program will be ineligible for farming for ten years and must be planted with permanent vegetative cover. Producers enrolled 1,894,764 acres of corn base acreage in the conservation program to take advantage of a corn ""bonus"" rental payment that was offered by USDA. The corn bonus, to be paid in generic comodity certificates, amounts to two dlrs per bushel, based on the ASCS program payment yield for corn, for each acre of corn based accepted into the reserve. The state showing the biggest enrollment in the conservation program during this signup was Texas with approximately 1.225 mln acres, followed by Iowa with 1.030 mln acres, Minnesota with 890,000 acres, Montana 875,000 acres, and Kansas with 842,000 acres. Other states showing big enrollment were Missouri with 646,000 acres, North Dakota with 588,000 acres, and Nebraska with 554,000 acres. In the corn belt states of Illinois and Indiana, 217,000 acres and 116,000 acres respectively were enrolled. Farm land signed up to date in the conservation program totals 19,488,587 acres. Bids on the previous signups ranged up to 90 dlrs per acre with an average of 45.52 dlrs."

cbt traders say u.s. conservation signup neutral,grain corn,"The 11,254,837 acres of highly erodable farmland submitted to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for the conservation reserve program was within trade guesses of 10-12 mln and should have an overall neutral impact on grain and soybean prices Monday, grain traders said. Farmers enrolled 1,894,764 acres of corn base acreage in the conservation program to take advantage of a corn bonus rental payment that was offered by the USDA, which may underpin new crop futures, they said. New crop corn prices firmed earlier this week on ideas of a large sign-up in the program. But traders noted that the poor yielding acres being set-aside will result in only a modest decrease in final production figures, since farmers will concentrate on high yielding land. Of a total 11,254,837 erodoble acres submitted, usda accepted 10,572,402 acres into the program at an average rental payment of 51.17 dlrs per acre. Farm land signed up to date now totals 19,488,587 acres."

u.s. conservation figures seen neutral/bearish,grain corn,"U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) figures for highly-erodible land enrolled into the Conservation Reserve Program were regarded by most grain analysts as neutral to bearish, although some said a full state-by-state breakdown would be needed to assess the full price impact. ""Out of 10.5 mln acres only 1.9 mln acres were accepted in corn -- That's neutral at best and perhaps bearish to what the trade was looking for,"" Dale Gustafson of Drexel Burnham Lambert said. The USDA said it had accepted 10,572,402 more acres into the conservation program out of bids on a total of 11,254,837 acres. Gustafson said he would not be changing his estimate of planted acreage for corn as a result of the latest figures, but some other analysts said they would adjust their estimates slightly. The USDA is due to release planting intentions figures March 31. Indications of a heavy sign-up in the conservation program recently lowered most trade estimates of corn planted acreage to 63.0 to 67.0 mln acres from 67.0 to 69.0 mln. Richard Loewy, analyst with Prudential Bache Securities, said there was not enough information to completely assess the conservation figures. ""The 1.9 mln acres on corn is certainly disappointing,"" he added. The USDA later released the state-by-state breakdown of the enrollment figures. Loewy said the initial figures appeared to be negative for both new crop corn and soybeans, and might possibly mean an upward adjustment in planting intention figures. Asked about the impact on the flow of generic certificates onto the market this spring, he said: ""The trade was definitely looking higher, so certificates are going to be less than expected."" The USDA offered a special corn ""bonus"" rental payment to the farmers to be paid in generic certificates. The bonus amounts to two dlrs per bushel, based on the farm program payment yield for corn, for each acre of corn accepted into the reserve. Katharina Zimmer, analyst for Merrill Lynch Futures, said the conservation sign-up was slightly higher than she had expected, although she noted that some trade expectations were considerably higher than the actual figures. ""I think it is friendly for the market, at least in the long run,"" she said. Susan Hackmann of AgriAnalysis said there was some confusion over whether trade ideas of an enrollment figure between 15 and 18 mln acres referred to the total sign-up or the latest addition. ""It seems the trade was looking for more acres to be bid into the program,"" she said. Hackmann said she would not make much change to her ideas about corn planting figures as a result of the conservation sign-up. She added that while some trade guesses were as low as 61 mln acres, she was looking for corn plantings to be in the high 60's. Zimmer of Merrill Lynch said she would be making a slight reduction of about one mln acres in her planting estimate to around 64 mln acres. New crop corn prices at the Chicago Board of Trade firmed earlier this week on ideas of a large sign-up in the program, despite the fact that acres enrolled are generally poor yielding and not likely to make a substantial difference to final production figures."
pdvsa to sign champlin refinery deal march 17,acq crude,"Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. said it will sign a contract March 17 to buy a half interest in a Corpus Christi, Texas refinery and related operations. The contract, to be signed by PDVSA and Champlin Petroleum's parent company, the Union Pacific Corp, will create a new joint venture called Champlin Refining. The state oil company said PDVSA will pay on the order of 30 mln dlrs for the half interest in Champlin. Energy minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said Wednesday the cost would be 33 mln dlrs in cash, plus an additional 60 mln in crude and refined oil shipments. PDVSA and Union Pacific have sought a line of credit from a group of North American and Japanese banks to finance the new company's working capital, the Venezuelan company said. Under the deal, PDVSA will supply up to 140,000 barrels a day to the refinery with the option to place 50,000 bpd more - mostly gasoline and distillates - through Champlin's distribution system in 10 U.S. states. The new company will be directed by a six-member board, with three representatives each from PDVSA and Union Pacific. According to PDVSA, Venezuelans will occupy such key positions such as treasurer and vice-president for manufacturing. The total capacity of the Champlin refinery is 160,000 bpd of crudes and another 40,000 bpd of intermediates. The plant will be able to handle 110,000 bpd of Venezuelan heavy crudes, which make up more than half of the country's crude oil exports."

ecuador adopts austerity program,cpi gas,"Ecuador announced an austerity program and a price freeze on key consumer goods as a result of last week's earthquake which killed at least 300 people. Presidency Minister Patricio Quevedo said in a televised address that the budget would be cut by five to 10 pct, government hiring would be frozen and salaries of top officials, including the president and cabinet, would be reduced. He also said a price freeze would be imposed on 20 basic consumer items, mainly food staples, while the price of petrol would rise by between 69 and 80 pct and bus fares would rise by 20 pct. Petrol supplies would also be limited. Information Ministry officials said the price freeze was aimed at protecting poor Ecuadoreans from a wave of specualtion. Violators would be severely punished, according to the price freeze order, signed by five cabinet ministers. The items for which prices were frozen included rice, sugar, cooking oil, potatoes, salt, wheat flour, cigarettes, soft drinks, school supplies and several kinds of vegetables. Ecuador's consumer price inflation was 23 pct in 1986. The price of 92-octane petrol rises to 110 sucres a U.S. Gallon from 65 sucres. Eighty-octane petrol increases to 90 sucres from 50."
yugoslavian oil firm starts working with french,pet-chem crude,"Yugoslavia's top oil and natural gas producer <Ina-Naftaplin> has started to implement a cooperation contract signed last year with the French petrochemical concern <Petro Chemie>, the official Tanjug news agency said. Under the deal Petro Chemie supplies oil to Ina refineries in Sisak and Rijeka and ships parts to 12 Yugoslav firms in the petrochemical, chemical, textile and plastics industries. The Yugoslav firms, in turn, will export oil products to France. Tanjug said this year's exchange will value 530 mln dlrs. Ina signed a similar deal with West Germany's Hoechst AG <HFAG.F> two years ago. Ina also has joint ventures and co-production projects, involving Yugoslavia's other main producer <Naftagas> of Novi Sad, with partners in Angola, Algeria and Tunisia, exploring for and exploiting oil and natural gas. An estimated 300,000 tonnes of oil will thus be obtained from fields in Angola over the next 15 years, Tanjug said. Ina accounts for some 75 pct of Yugoslavia's total oil production, which amounts to 4.2 mln tonnes a year. Ina earned more than 154 mln dlrs from exports of goods and services to 39 countries last year and ranks among Yugoslavia's leading export enterprises. In a separate statement issued through Tanjug, Ina said it has successfully completed the first drill at the depth of over 3,000 meters in the Bay of Baes, in Tunisia. Ina is jointly prospecting with the U.S. Firm Conoco for oil and gas there. Work on a second drill, below 4,000 meters, would start soon in the Bay of Gabes, the statement said. Ina would invest about 8.5 mln dlrs in prospecting in the Gabes area. Conoco, which has completed geological prospecting for the Tunisian government, has transferred one third of its option rights in the region to Ina, it said."

brazilian bank workers decide on national strike,crude ship,"Brazilian bank workers voted to launch a nationwide strike this month, compounding labour unrest arising from the failure of the government's anti-inflation plan. At a rally in this city, about 100 km northwest of Sao Paulo, about 5,000 bank workers voted to strike on March 24 unless their demand for 100 pct pay rises is met. Wilson Gomes de Moura, president of the national confederation which groups the bank employees' 152 unions representing 700,000 workers, told Reuters the indefinite stoppage would affect all banks. The vote came as a stoppage by seamen entered its third week and as 55,000 oil workers threatened action against the state-owned petroleum company Petrobras. The government ordered thousands of troops into the refineries on Tuesday to forestall any occupation, but the troops were removed yesterday. Petrobras said it had requested their withdrawal because the refineries were calm and oil workers had indicated their willingess to negotiate next Wednesday. The government has also sent marines into the main ports. A spokesman at strike headquarters for the seamen in Rio de Janeiro said unions were studying an offer by private shipowners for a 120 pct pay rise. Seamen employed by two small companies have already accepted a 120 pct pay rise and returned to work, as have about 5,000 seamen employed by Petrobras. Last week also saw widespread protests by hundreds of thousands of farmers over what they see as unfairly high interest rates charged by banks. According to official estimates, prices rose by more than 33 pct in the first two months of this year."
tense trade ties to dominate ec talks,trade veg-oil,"Tense trade relations with the U.S. And Japan and concern about the foreign impact of a proposed European Community (EC) tax on edible oils and fats are expected to dominate talks by EC foreign ministers here tomorrow. EC diplomats said Britain demanded the early debate on the EC Executive Commission's proposal to impose a hefty tax on domestic and imported oils and fats in an attempt to head off a proposal it sees as extremely damaging to EC foreign relations. The proposal was the most controversial part of a reform package, due to be discussed by EC farm ministers later this month, of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy -- widely seen as the root cause of the EC's persistent financial problems and of tensions with major trading partners. The proposal is described by its promoters as a stabilisation program which would penalise a new sector going into massive overproduction and complement proposals to cut cereals and dairy production, rather than a straight forward tax. They say it would not only curb the growth of oils and fats production and prevent imports from filling any vaccum left by a fall in EC output, but would also save the EC some two billion European Currency Units, over two billion dlrs, in farm costs. It has provoked strong protests from domestic producers as well as foreign exporters, led by the United States. The diplomats said the protests had been received from most corners of the developing and developed world, ranging from Senegal, Malaysia and Indonesia, to Brazil, Argentina, Canada, Iceland and Norway. The proposal had little chance of approval by EC governments, with West Germany as strongly opposed to it as Britain, and Denmark, the Netherlands and Portugal also unconvinced of its political or economic wisdom. Even Mediterranean countries such as Italy, France and Greece, which backed similar proposals in the past, did not seem as enthusiastic now because olive oil had been added to the list of products affected. But the diplomats said a protectionist lobby in the U.S. And elsewhere was using the proposal as an excuse to promote anti-EC action, and the foreign ministers' debate should demonstrate the strength of feeling against the proposal within the EC and deprive its oponents of this argument. The ministers were also due to discuss proposals in the U.S. Congress for a range of protecionist legislation such as a bill that would curb EC textile exports. The diplomats said the ministers were expected to strongly back a Commission warning to Washington that such a bill, if enacted, would provoke swift EC retaliation."
peru begins foreign exchange rationing,money-fx reserves,"Peru will put into effect Monday a foreign exchange rationing system for imports designed to stop a slide in the country's international reserves, a government decree in the Official Gazette said. Under the system, importers will be required to present a bill from the foreign seller of goods and apply for a license for foreign exchange. The central bank will have 10 days to decide whether to issue the required foreign exchange. Net international reserves now total about 800 mln dlrs compared to 1.54 billion dlrs a year ago. The system will be effective until the end of 1988. A ceiling for foreign exchange availability will be set by a council with members from the central bank, the economy ministry and the planning and foreign trade institutes. The central bank will issue licenses to procure foreign exchange in accordance with guidelines set by the council. Peru's reserves fell sharply due to a drop in the trade surplus to about five mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.1 billion in 1985, according to preliminary central bank estimates. Total exports dropped to 2.50 billion dlrs last year against 2.97 billion in 1985. Imports last year rose sharply as gross domestic product grew by about 8.5 pct, the highest economic growth level registered in 12 years. Imports were about 2.49 billion dlrs in 1986 against 1.87 billion in 1985, according to preliminary estimates. The cushion of reserves allowed Peru to take a hard-line debt stance last year and suspend most payments due on its 14.3 billion dlr foreign debt."
"tanzania wants to export 200,000 tonnes of maize",grain corn,"Tanzania seeks to export a surplus of 200,000 tonnes of maize from last year's bumper harvest, agriculture minister Paul Bomani said yesterday. The 1986 maize crop was officially estimated at 2.1 mln tonnes, but only a fraction of this was marketed, with most grain consumed by the farmers who grew it. The state-owned National Milling Corp (NMC) meanwhile said it is trying to sell 190,742 tonnes of maize stored in different parts of the country. NMC acting general manager John Rubibira said Tanzania has only 56,000 tonnes of silo storage capacity, concentrated in Dar es Salaam, Arusha in the north and Iringa in central Tanzania. In addition, the country has 450,000 tonnes of flat storage capacity, he added. Rubibira said the government is planning to build new silos in the main maize producing areas of Iringa, Mbeya, Ruvuma and Rukwa."
australian current account deficit seen narrowing,bop trade,"Australia's current account deficit for February is expected to narrow to a range of between 700 mln and one billion dlrs, from the unrevised January level of 1.29 billion, market economists polled by Reuters said. Statistics Bureau February figures are out tomorrow. The economists said a key element in the narrowing would be a reversal of the drop in exports which took place in January, after a sharp rise in December when the deficit was only 598 mln dlrs. As an example they quoted wheat export volume, which rose about 30 pct in February after dropping as much in January. A lack of aircraft imports in February should also contribute on the trade account although it is still likely to remain in deficit, the economists said. Other positive influences on the current account balance should be a decline in the invisibles deficit following a seasonal fall in interest payments and the dropping out of certain official aid payments, they said. They said the Australian dollar, which last week touched an eight-month high of 0.6900 U.S. Dlrs but is now around the 0.6800 level, should not react adversely to the figures unless the current account shortfall tops one billion dlrs."
"treasury, foreign reserves are jordan's priorities",reserves money-fx,"Jordan's key economic priorities are having a sound national treasury and adequate foreign exchange reserves, Prime Minister Zeid al-Rifa'i said. ""First, the national treasury should be in sound shape when dealing with the public and other countries so that its credibility is preserved,"" he said in a television interview Saturday. ""The second priority is to maintain an acceptable level of foreign exchange reserves to provide (the) stability and confidence needed by the government to meet foreign commitments."" Rifa'i said Jordan's outstanding government-guaranteed and commercial loans total 902 mln dinars with a debt service ratio of 14.9 pct. The figure was sharply lower than the 1.02 billion dinars in outstanding loans at the end of September, according to latest Central Bank figures. Rifa'i dismissed the view of some bankers and economists here that the dinar, which is pegged to a basket of currencies, is overvalued. ""The dinar is strong and stable and we intend to preserve its stability,"" he said. The prime minister said he hoped the next Arab summit would tackle the question of continuing financial aid to Jordan. Under a 10-year agreement reached in 1978, Jordan was to receive a total of 1.25 billion dlrs annually from Algeria, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to help it resist Israel. But only Saudi Arabia met its obligations, while the others failed because of falling income due to lower oil prices."

bank of japan satisfied with yen at current range,money-fx yen gnp,"The Bank of Japan is satisfied with the yen around its current range, a senior central bank official told reporters. He said the pledge by major industrial nations in Paris last month to cooperate to hold exchange rates around current ranges applied in both directions, a dollar fall or a dollar rise. Unilateral intervention itself cannot ensure currency stability, but it can be useful when coordinated with other policies and with other central banks, he said. The Bank of Japan is rather confident currency stability will continue for some time, the senior bank official said, but declined to be more specific. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told parliament on Friday the current dollar/yen exchange rate is not necessarily satisfactory for the Japanese economy. Asked what factors might destabilize the markets, the official cited a lessening of market fear about intervention, a completely unexpected change in the economy of Japan, the U.S. Or West Germany, or resumption of comments by government officials seeking to talk the dollar up or down. The senior bank official said he expects Japan's gross national product (GNP) to grow three pct or slightly more in the fiscal year beginning in April. That would be little changed from the performance expected this year. Domestic demand may grow nearly four pct in 1987/88, but the external sector will have a negative impact on GNP of nearly one percentage point, he said. He said there was virtually no room for further monetary policy action to boost the economy. The economy's performance in the future very much depends on fiscal policy, he added. The central bank's monetary policy has already done its part in stimulating the economy, the senior bank official said. The Bank of Japan has cut its discount rate five times over the last year and a half. Although the central bank does not see any imminent risk of inflation, there could be some problems in the future, he said. ""We are sitting on a barrel of powder, but fortunately it may still be wet,"" he added. Liquidity among private households and especially the corporate sector has increased substantially, he said. The liquidity is the reason for the recent boom of stock exchange prices, the bank official said. This inflow of funds into the stock exchange, occurring also in other countries, may continue, he said. The senior official said the Bank of Japan is hoping Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker will be re-appointed when his current term expires later this year. ""He's a great man,"" the official said, adding that more and more people expect his reappointment. Turning to exchange rates, the official said the substantial drop in the dollar is beginning to have an effect on reducing the imbalance in world trade, even though the impact has taken longer than expected to show through. Even the U.S. Trade position has begun to feel the impact, although so far it has not been very strong, he said."

bundesbank adds money market liquidity,money-fx interest,"The Bundesbank came into the domestic money market to add temporary liquidity through federal government funds as call money rates rose above 4.0 pct, dealers said. They estimated that the bulk of liquidity was added at about 3.95 pct. Call money fell to 3.90/4.0 pct after the move. It had been 3.80/90 on Friday. The move came as call money extended a rise begun Friday after the Bundesbank took up some six billion marks owed to it by other European central banks after currency interventions in the framework of European Monetary System in January. Rates could ease further in trading today but dealers expect them to rise later in the week as banks begin paying out funds for tax payments on behalf of clients. Some 30 billion marks is likely to leave the market this month, with the bulk being paid out next week. In anticipation of this liquidity drain, banks have stocked up reserves at the Bundesbank. On Thursday, minimum reserve holdings declined to 57.0 billion marks from 60.0 billion on Wednesday but were well above the 53.2 billion held on Tuesday. Daily average reserve holdings rose slightly to 54.7 billion marks from 54.5 billion. The daily average reserve holdings were above the level of around 51 billion marks dealers said is needed for the required daily average for the month. With the heavy tax drain in March, banks are likely to remain cautious about taking more liquidity out of reserves than is absolutely necessary. However, a new securities repurchase pact likely to be added next week to replace a facility expiring then could somewhat offset the drain. The Bundesbank is expected to allocate more than the 3.4 billion marks which is due to be rolled over, dealers said."

Unilateral intervention itself cannot ensure currency stability, but it can be useful when coordinated with other policies and with other central banks, he said. The Bank of Japan is rather confident currency stability will continue for some time, the senior bank official said, but declined to be more specific. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told parliament on Friday the current dollar/yen exchange rate is not necessarily satisfactory for the Japanese economy. Asked what factors might destabilize the markets, the official cited a lessening of market fear about intervention, a completely unexpected change in the economy of Japan, the U.S. Or West Germany, or resumption of comments by government officials seeking to talk the dollar up or down. The senior bank official said he expects Japan's gross national product (GNP) to grow three pct or slightly more in the fiscal year beginning in April. That would be little changed from the performance expected this year. Domestic demand may grow nearly four pct in 1987/88, but the external sector will have a negative impact on GNP of nearly one percentage point, he said. He said there was virtually no room for further monetary policy action to boost the economy. The economy's performance in the future very much depends on fiscal policy, he added. The central bank's monetary policy has already done its part in stimulating the economy, the senior bank official said. The Bank of Japan has cut its discount rate five times over the last year and a half. Although the central bank does not see any imminent risk of inflation, there could be some problems in the future, he said. ""We are sitting on a barrel of powder, but fortunately it may still be wet,"" he added. Liquidity among private households and especially the corporate sector has increased substantially, he said. The liquidity is the reason for the recent boom of stock exchange prices, the bank official said. This inflow of funds into the stock exchange, occurring also in other countries, may continue, he said."
u.k. money market given further 30 mln stg help,money-fx interest,"The Bank of England said it provided the money market with a further 30 mln stg assistance. This brings the Bank's total help so far today to 120 mln stg and compares with its upward revised estimate that the system would face a shortage of some 1.15 billon stg. The central bank bought bills for resale to the market in equal amounts on April 1, 2 and 3 at an interest rate of 10-7/16 pct."
peru begins foreign exchange rationing,money-fx reserves,"Peru will put into effect today a foreign exchange rationing system for imports designed to stop a slide in the country's international reserves, a government decree in the Official Gazette said. Under the system, importers will be required to present a bill from the foreign seller of goods and apply for a license for foreign exchange. The central bank will have 10 days to decide whether to issue the required foreign exchange. Net international reserves now total about 800 mln dlrs compared to 1.54 billion dlrs a year ago. The system will be effective until the end of 1988. A ceiling for foreign exchange availability will be set by a council with members from the central bank, the economy ministry and the planning and foreign trade institutes. The central bank will issue licenses to procure foreign exchange in accordance with guidelines set by the council. Peru's reserves fell sharply due to a drop in the trade surplus to about five mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.1 billion in 1985, according to preliminary central bank estimates. Total exports dropped to 2.50 billion dlrs last year against 2.97 billion in 1985."
taiwan says u.s. wants taiwan dollar to appreciate,money-fx trade,"The United States wants Taiwan's currency to appreciate faster to reduce Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S., A senior trade official said. Board of Foreign Trade director Vincent Siew told reporters on Saturday U.S. Officials told him in Washington last week that unless Taiwan allowed its dollar to rise faster it would face retaliation. Siew returned from Washington on Friday after the U.S responded to Taiwan's request to increase its textile export quotas by promising further talks in May. Taiwan's surplus with the U.S. Hit a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1986. Washington signed a three-year accord with Taipei last year limiting textile export growth to 0.5 pct a year. Siew said the Taiwan dollar had risen by about 15 pct against the U.S. Dollar since September 1985. It surged last week amid indications Washington was seeking a major rise in its value. It rose four cents against the U.S. Dollar on Saturday to close at 34.59. Western trade sources told Reuters Taiwan and the U.S. Have been holding talks on the currency issue but added it is not clear how far Washington wants to see the Taiwan dollar rise."
u.k. and germany lead attack on ec farm reforms,trade veg-oil,"Britain and West Germany told their European Community partners they would strongly oppose major elements of proposals to rid the EC of its farm surpluses. At a meeting of EC foreign ministers, Britain called for a full debate on a proposed tax on edible oils and fats that has already angered EC consumer groups and unleashed Washington-led protests from exporters to the EC, diplomats said. West Germany, also opposed to the oils and fats tax, will advise the meeting formally later today it cannot countenance other proposals that could hit German farmers, they added. They said West Germany's objections were put in a letter this weekend from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to Jacques Delors, the president of the EC's Executive Commission which had put forward the proposals last month in a bid to avoid a new EC cash crisis. Kohl reiterated German objections to proposed cereals production curbs but reserved his harshest criticism for a proposed dismantling of Monetary Compensatory Amounts (MCAs) - a system of cross-border subsidies and taxes which level out foreign exchange fluctuations for farm exports. Kohl made clear the dismantling would mainly hit German farmers who, without MCAs, would find it much more difficult to export to weaker currency states, which means virtually all other 11 EC states, diplomats said. Britain initiated the discussion on the proposal to impose a hefty tax on domestic and imported oils and fats because it could seriously damage EC trade relations. The diplomats said the United States had been the most outspoken among foreign critics of the proposal, describing it as a breach of the EC's obligations under the world trade body GATT. But protests had also come from other exporters to the EC, such as Senegal, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil, Argentina, Iceland and Norway, they added. Britain has often lined up against West Germany on the farm reform issue in the past but is keen to avoid measures that could spark a damaging trade war with the U.S. Foreign ministers were unlikely to take a decision on either the oils and fats tax or the MCA proposals today, diplomats said. But their discussion should make clear that neither has a chance of surviving when it comes up for substantive consideration by EC farm ministers later this month, they added."
leading industrial nations to meet in april,money-fx dlr interest,"Leading industrial nations will meet again next month to review their accord on currency stability, but U.S. Officials said financial markets are convinced for now the countries will live up to commitments to speed up economic growth. The narrow currency movements of recent weeks strongly suggests the six leading industrial countries have tamed the normally unruly financial markets and next month's talks seem likely to build on that stability. A Reagan administration official said the Paris agreement last month was the main reason markets were calm. But he said in an interview that financial markets also understood, ""That all six countries concluded that the measures to be taken over a period of time in the future should foster stability of exchange rates around current levels. That is in fact what has happened since Paris."" Monetary analysts said stability has been helped in part by the decision of industrial nations to bury the hatchet and cease to quarrel over short-term policy objectives. Instead they have focused on medium-term policy goals, but left room to adjust their agreements with periodic meetings. The official refused to comment, however, on whether the agreement included a secret pact to consider further coordinated interest rate cuts -- a measure industrial nations have taken jointly several times in the past year. On February 22, the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada agreed that major currencies were within ranges broadly reflecting underlying economic conditions, given commitments by Washington to cut its budget deficit and by Toyko and Bonn to boost economic growth. The shake-up would strengthen the U.S. Position in future international talks. ""I think these changes will strengthen the President's hand politically and the stronger he is politically the better off we are with the Congress and the better off we are in international fora,"" said the official, an Administration economic policymaker. ""So it would be beneficial to the continued conduct of our initiatives."" But the official also said the Administration would resist calls for a tax increase to cut the budget deficit -- a target Europeans say is crucial to help curb economic instability. Currency analysts believe the Paris agreement set secret short-term target ranges for their currencies with a specific agreement to defend those bands with intervention. According to market sources, the ranges agreed were 1.60 to 1.90 marks to the dollar, and 140 to 155 yen to the dollar. There is no official confirmation that specific bands were set, although the agreement used the term ""ranges"", for the first time in an international economic agreement. The Paris accord stated the six would cooperate closely to foster currency stability around current levels. Last week, dealers said the Federal Reserve intervened to stop the dollar rising against the mark, which had breached 1.86 to the dollar. British authorities are also understood to have intervened to curb sterling's strength. International monetary sources say finance ministers and central bankers, who will review market performance and their own economic prospects, will reassemble again in Washington just before the April 9 policymaking meeting of the International Monetary Fund. The sources said Italy, which refused to join the Paris pact, was invited back by Treasury Secretary James Baker. Since Paris, there are signs West German growth is slowing, while U.S. Officials said they were giving Japan until April to show that an economic stimulus package was in the offing. Signs of concern about German prospects emerged recently when Bundesbank (central bank) president Karl Otto Poehl told bankers he would consider cutting West German interest rates if the Fed was ready to follow suit. A Reagan Administration official said this would show there had been some change in approach on the part of the central bank in Germany. But he declined to comment on the prospects for action by the Fed and the Bundesbank. ""If there is such a provision it is private and if I talked about it, it would no longer be private,"" said the official, who asked not to be identified. Public comments by Fed officials suggest the central bank is keeping credit conditions broadly unchanged, but if the major economies continue to show sluggish growth and the U.S. Trade deficit remains stubbornly high, further coordinated action could be on the April agenda."
indonesia plans to build palm oil terminal,veg-oil palm-oil ship,"Indonesia will build a crude palm oil terminal at a new port on Batam island, south of Singapore, Research and Technology Minister Yusuf Habibie said. The terminal will be able to handle 2.1 mln tonnes of crude palm oil from new plantations in northern Sumatra and western Kalimantan (Borneo), he said. A tender for engineering work on the Asia Port project will be offered mid-year. Habibie did not say when the terminal was expected to be operational."
"indonesia has imported palm oil, traders say",veg-oil palm-oil,"Indonesia has imported palm oil this year and is likely to take more, trade sources said. They were commenting on a weekend Jakarta report quoting a Ministry of Trade spokesman as saying Indonesia had not issued licences to import the commodity. He also said there was no sign of a shortage of palm oil in Indonesia. A major palm oil dealer said he shipped Malaysian palm oil to Indonesia in February, additional vessels were loading this month and other vessels had been earmarked for April. Other operators claimed they had palm oil booked for Indonesia but would not disclose tonnages. Traders said palm oil production in Indonesia this year had been below expectations and current stocks were low. They said licences were issued at the start of the year to import crude palm oil but were subsequently revised to include RBD olein and RBD oil. Last week there were rumours in European markets that Indonesia had issued licences to import around 135,000 tonnes of palm oil for deliveries commencing April. An Indonesian Ministry of Trade official said this was incorrect. Some traders here said the total could be more. Others said they could include those issued earlier this year and applications not yet granted."

"zambia, imf talks stall on food subsidies",money-fx grain corn,"Zambia's talks with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a financial rescue package have run into difficulties on the issue of food subsidies, an official newspaper said. The Times of Zambia, which is run by the ruling United National Independence Party (UNIP), quoted official sources as saying the IMF and World Bank had refused to continue financing food subsidies and were pressing the government to explain how it proposes to pay for them. President Kenneth Kaunda tried to abolish maize subsidies last December, in line with IMF recommendations, but the move caused maize meal prices to double overnight and led to riots. The subsidies were immediately restored as part of moves to quell the disturbances. The Times of Zambia said another major issue in the government's current talks with the IMF and World Bank was the remodelling of Zambia's foreign exchange auction. The central bank's weekly auction of foreign exchange to the private sector has been suspended since the end of January, pending modifications to slow down the rate of devaluation and dampen fluctuations in the exchange rate. The kwacha slid to around 15 per dollar under the auction, losing 85 pct of its value in 16 months, but since the end of January has been revalued to a fixed rate of nine per dollar. Banking sources said Zambia was persuaded by the World Bank and IMF to lift its proposed ceiling of 12.50 kwacha per dollar on the currency's devaluation once the auctions restart."
ccc accepts wheat bid for w africa countries,grain wheat,"The Commodity Credit Corportion, CCC, has accepted a bid for an export bonus to cover the sale of 15,000 tonnes of U.S. wheat to West African countries, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. The dark northern spring wheat is for shipment May 15-June 15, 1987. The bonus of 40.05 dlrs per tonne was made to Peavey Company and will be paid in the form of commodities from the CCC inventory, it said. An additional 315,500 tonnes of wheat are still available to West African countries under the Export Enhancement Program initiative announced October 30, 1986, it said."
u.s. soy producers think ec oils tax unlikely,oilseed veg-oil soybean,"American soybean producers are confident the proposed European Community (EC) tax on vegetable oils and fats will be rejected but are leaving nothing to chance, American Soybean Association (ASA) president-elect Wayne Bennett said. Bennett, who is leading one of three soybean producer delegations on a lobbying tour of EC capitals, was speaking at a lunch. After meetings at the Economics and Foreign ministries this morning, he said the Dutch Government had indicated it would vote against the proposal, as had a number of other countries. ""Our information suggests we will have the required number of votes in Brussels to prevent the tax proposal going forward,"" he said. ""The proposal has been talked of in Brussels for the past 20 years, and dropped every time. What we want now is to kill it once and for all,"" Bennett added. Backing up the soybean producers' active lobbying, the U.S. Government has also indicated it will be prepared to retaliate with penal import taxes if the proposal does get through, he said. The U.S. Government also feels it has a good case to fight the proposed tax in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), a U.S. Embassy spokesman said. U.S. Exports of soybeans and products to the EC account for one-fifth of annual production, and are worth about 2.5 billion dlrs a year, Bennett said. The proposed tax on oils and fats would hit U.S. Producers badly while at the same time virtually doubling the price of soyoil in the EC, which would suffer far worse than other higher-priced oils because of the nature of the proposed tax, he added. The revenue to the EC from the tax would simply be used to finance the EC's own oilseed subsidy machine, he said. ""We in the ASA are dedicated free-traders. We helped defeat the Wine Equity Act two years ago, but we will not stand by and watch our own farmers suffer from such protectionist EC measures,"" Bennett said. ""The mood in the U.S. Is turning increasingly protectionist, and the EC's actions are fueling the chances of a trade war,"" he added."

Fed funds opened at 6-1/4 pct and remained at that level late this morning. Friday funds averaged 6.05 pct."
spain to relax exchange controls,money-fx peseta,"The Bank of Spain is relaxing exchange controls to help put Spanish banks on an equal footing with European Community competitors by the 1993 deadline for the ending of restrictions, a central bank spokesman said. ""The measures to take effect by June were designed to lift restrictions on foreign currency operations, in line with deregulation in the banking industry,"" he said in a telephone interview. The spokesman said the relaxation of exchange controls highlighted a broader package of reforms announced last Friday. The central bank said in a statement the measures included increased provisions for high-risk borrowers and a provision for future pension fund obligations. It said the measures were the latest steps to deregulate Spain's financial sector, a move triggered by entry into the Community last year. Spain has five years to complete bank deregulation, a process that began in 1978 when the government allowed foreign banks to open branches. Since then 39 foreign banks have come into the market and they now control about 15 pct of the system's lending assets. Residents in Spain can now borrow freely in foreign currency up to the equivalent of 1.5 billion pesetas against a previous ceiling of 750 mln pesetas. The 750 mln peseta limit was set last March. Between that date and the end of last year some 430 mln dlrs flowed into the country on new foreign currency loans. The central bank spokesman said operations over 1.5 billion pesetas were technically subject to authorisation, but would be given clearance if the government failed to act in 15 days. Spanish banks will also be allowed to expand their foreign currency funding, formerly obtainable through deposits, by issuing certificates of deposit, bonds and commercial paper. They can also employ these funds to invest in foreign issues, while before they had to be converted into deposits. Foreign exchange operations can be in mixed currencies, instead of having to borrow and lend in the same currency. The central bank has also lifted the restriction on the amount of foreign exchange loans, which previously were limited to three times a bank's capital equity. The latest deregulation measures were welcomed by most bankers, in contrast to rulings issued earlier this month which imposed a 19 pct reserve requirement on new convertible peseta funds held by banks and freed short term deposit rates. The reserve requirement, which was already in place on normal peseta deposits, was intended to curb short-term foreign speculative capital which is entering the country and threatening the government's money supply growth target. A foreign banker said high reserve requirements, which now account for about 30 pct of deposits, placed Spanish banks at a disadvantage with European competitors. The government reduced fixed asset investment requirements to 11 pct from 23 pct to help offset the negative impact of interest rate deregulation. ""The real problem is the freeing of interest rates,"" the banker said. ""This is going to take a big bite out of profits."" The ruling lifted a six pct ceiling on interest rates paid on deposits of up to 180 days. The chairman of one of Spain's leading banks said the measure was expected to bring a 20 pct drop in profits this year."

union votes to strike dakota city ibp plant,carcass livestock,"Members of the United Food and Commercial Workers union, UFCW, local 222 voted Sunday to go on strike against Iowa Beef Processors Inc Dakota City, Nebraska, plant, effective Tuesday. The company submitted their latest offer to the union at the same time announcing that they would end the lockout as of tomorrow that started December 14. Members unanimously rejected the latest company offer that was submitted to the union late last week. An overwhelming majority of the approximately 2,500 members attending the meeting then voted to go on strike, UFCW union spokesman Allen Zack said. Zack said the company's offer for a cut in wages was unacceptable and said IBP was refusing to bargain in good faith. IBP's latest offer included wage cuts of 60 cents an hour for slaughter operations and a 45 cents an hour cut in pay for processing workers. The cut follows the 1.07 dlr cut in pay workers received in 1982 and the wage freeze that has lasted since then, Zack said. The offer also eliminated overtime after eight hours following the normal 40 hour work week, he added."
brazil says debt crisis is world problem,trade gnp,"Brazilian Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said his country's foreign debt crisis could only be solved by changes in the international financial system. Speaking to a business conference he said ""It is not Brazil that has to make adjustments with the IMF (International Monetary Fund). It is the international financial community that is taking away resources from the developing countries."" ""The crisis is not in Brazil, a country that has had the third biggest trade surplus ...In the past two years Brazil had remitted 24 billion dlrs in debt servicing and received only two billion in fresh funds,"" he added. Funaro said that during his recent trip to the U.S., Europe and Japan to explain Brazil's decision last month to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt, he stressed the country's commitment to growth. ""We need to and will make the effort (to solve the debt problem) but we cannot make an effort that means we stop growing,"" he said, adding that political and not purely commercial solutions were needed to the debt crisis. Brazil, whose 108 billion dlr foreign debt is the largest in the developing world, has been under pressure from official and private creditors to work out an economic adjustment program with the IMF to combat rocketing inflation and foreign payments problems. President Jose Sarney's government has repeatedly refused to approach the Fund, arguing that an IMF programme would lead to recession. Funaro said that in his talks with creditors he had tried to restore credibility in the country in the hope of finding a lasting solution to the debt problem. ""We are negotiating so that the debt question should not be one of continuous crisis."" To sustain internal growth Brazil would have to import more machinery and equipment this year and export fewer raw materials. The country was thus targetting a fall in this year's trade surplus to 8.0 billion dlrs from 1986's 9.5 billion. Domestically, Funaro said economies had led to a reduction in the public sector deficit to 2.7 pct of gross domestic product in 1986, the lowest for many years and that this should fall to 1.5 pct this year."
around 3.5 mln acres said to be idled by 0/92,grain wheat corn cotton sorghum barley corn,"A 0/92 program would have very little impact on U.S. acreage, prompting farmers to idle only an additional 3.5 mln acres of cropland every year, according to a report from the Agriculture Department. The savings resulting from the additional 3.5 mln acres idled would be a little over 400 mln dlrs in loan savings, 35 mln dlrs in transportation and storage savings, and 10-20 mln dlrs per year in deficiency payment savings, the report said. The USDA report asssessed the impacts of the proposed 0/92 acreage program for wheat, corn, cotton, sorghum and barley. Last year, almost 245 mln acres of those crops were harvested. ""The likelihood that the 0-92 provisiion will cause very large acreages to be removed from crop production is quite small,"" the report said. ""The returns on typical farms still favor participation in the usual acreage reduction programs and seeding the permitted acreage,"" the USDA report said. The 0/92 program, which would allow farmers to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of their deficiency payment, would be most used by producers in high production/high risk areas where cost of production is high, said Keith Collins, director of USDA's economics analysis staff. ""In the heart of the corn belt, you would not get that much participation,"" Collins said. USDA estimated that an additional one mln acres of wheat would be ildled under 0/92, 1.5 mln acres of corn, 500,000 acres of sorghum and barley and 500,000 acres of cotton. Production from these idled acres would be equivalent to 40 mln bushels of wheat, 180 mln bushels of corn, 20 mln bushels of sorghum, 10 mln bushels of barley, and 500,000 bales of cotton, the report said. ""In determining whether to participate, a producer would need to weigh the expected cash costs of production against the loan rate ... The risk that market prices may rise above the expected levels and reduce the deficiency payment also must be considered,"" according to the analysis. ""What you're giving up under 0/92 is the difference between the loan rate and the cost of production,"" Collins said. For producers with low production costs, that difference is greater and can be applied to paying variable costs, he said. Under these cicumstances, farmers would not want to go along with 0/92. But for high cost producers, 0/92 would be more attractive. Also, as loan rates get lower, Collins said there would be more incentives to participate in a 0/92 program. ""I would admit that its impacts would be very marginal at first, but it is a step towards the goal of separating production decisions from government payments,"" Collins said. In a speech earlier today before the National Grains and Feed Association, USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said it is too late to implement 0/92 for 1987 crops since program signup will be over by the end of this month."

u.s. could complain to gatt on canada corn duty,grain corn,"U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter suggested the U.S. could file a formal complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) challenging Canada's decision to impose duties on U.S. corn imports. Asked about the Canadian government decision to apply a duty of 84.9 cents per bushel on U.S. corn shipments, Yeutter said the U.S. could file a formal complaint with GATT under the dispute settlement procedures of the subsidies code. Other U.S. options would be to appeal the decision in Canadian courts, or to retaliate against Canadian goods, a lower-level U.S. trade official said. However, retaliation is an unlikely step, at least initially, that official said. No decision on U.S. action is expected at least until after documents on the ruling are received here later this week."

norway approves trade ban against south africa,trade ship crude,"Norway's parliament has approved an extensive trade ban against South Africa but left shipowners a key loophole through which controversial oil shipments on Norwegian tankers may continue, government officials said. The unilateral boycott, proposed by Norway's minority Labour government, gives domestic companies until late September to cut remaining trade ties with South Africa and Namibia. ""The legislation discussed today must not be seen as an isolated measure, but as a step in an international process,"" Norway's foreign minister Thorvald Stoltenberg told parliament. Government officials said they hope the move will intensify international pressure against the Pretoria regime's apartheid policies. Sweden, in a similar move last week, promised to halt all trade with South Africa by October. Norway's boycott, although forbidding crude oil shipments to South Africa on Norwegian-owned tankers, makes an important exception for ships whose final destination is decided while they are at sea. Oil cargoes are often resold by trades after loading, making it difficult for shipowners to know their ships' final port at the start of a voyage. Critics said the bill leaves the door open for continued oil shipments to South Africa. They called for stricter sanctions to stop all Norwegian shipping to South Africa. Norwegian tankers supplied South Africa with about 30 pct of its crude imports during the early 1980s, but the trade has dropped sharply to just one cargo in the last three months, trade ministry officials said. The latest trade figures show Norwegian imports from South Africa dropped 36 pct to 160 mln crowns during the first eight months of 1986, while exports plunged 52 pct to 265 mln crowns from the year-ago figure. ""Many would say that the law has already had its effect because of the dramatic drop in trade between South African and Norway,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Per Paust told Reuters. ""Norwegian business at an early stage started restructuring its relations with South Africa in anticipation of the law. ""No one has said the boycott will have a profound effect on international trade with South Africa, but it is an important political statement by the Norwegian government,"" he said. The Oslo government said it will review the effects of the ban on Norwegian industry after two years and may propose amendments if industry can show it is hurt by the law. Norwegian imports from South Africa are limited mainly to high-grade manganese and coppernickle ores used in it ferro-alloys and light metals industries. Metals manufacturers estimate some 2,000 jobs could be affected by the boycott is suitable replacements for these ores are not found. The legislation now goes on to the upper house for formal ratification later this week, parliamentarians said."

ethiopia minister sees africa debt payment problem,trade coffee,"Africa may have to follow Brazil in halting foreign debt payments unless industrialised nations are prepared to be more flexible in trade and economic policy, Ethiopian trade minister Tesfay Dinka said. Growing protectionism and declining commodity prices had caused a major deterioration in the export earnings of all developing countries, he said in an opening speech to a meeting of African trade ministers in Addis Ababa. Unless there was an early improvement in developing countries' terms of trade ""the only choice is to follow the route that Brazil appears to have taken,"" Tesfay said. The two-day meeting of delegates from 50 African states was called to work out a consensus ahead of the Group of 77 ministerial meeting in Havana next month, when the developing countries will debate their strategy in economic negotiations with the West. Tesfay accused the West of intransigence in the negotiation of recent commodity agreements. The failure of the International Coffee Organisation to agree on the reintroduction of export quotas would mean ""several African countries will not have the foreign exchange to import essential items,"" he said. Coffee accounts for 60 pct of Ethiopian exports and the recent fall in world coffee prices has sharply reduced the country's foreign exchange earnings. Adebayo Adedeji, the executive secretary of the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa, told the meeting that there was an increasing net outflow of resources from Africa. He blamed this on high interest rates, debt servicing and the repatriation of profits by foreign investors. Africa paid 13 billion dlrs to service its total foreign debt last year and by 1990 annual service payments are expected to rise to between 16 and 24 billion, Adedeji said. He accused industrialised countries of failing to provide more resources to implement the U.N. Program for Africa's economic recovery and development, despite Africa's willingness to raise two thirds of the capital from domestic sources. The U.N. Program, approved last year, calls for 128 billion dlrs of economic investment in Africa over five years. Western donors were asked to contribute 46 billion dlrs, with the rest being raised from local resources, but Adedeji said the donors had not responded as hoped. In view of this poor response, he said ""it is possible that by the year 2,000 nearly all African countries, except a few, will be categorised as least developed countries."" At present, 27 of Africa's 50-odd states are officially listed in this category."
usda details conservation crop enrollment,grain corn wheat soybean oilseed barley sorghum cotton rice,"Farmers enrolled over 6.5 mln acres of program crops in the latest conservation reserve program signup and around four mln acres of non-program crops, Agriculture Department conservation specialists said. Soybean acreage amounted to less than two mln acres of the non-program crop acreage enrolled, a USDA analyst said. Heavy enrollment of non-base acreage in wheat states, of which a big percentage would be fallow and non-soybean land, accounted for a large portion of the non-program acreage, the analyst said. Wheat and corn acreage comprised slightly over 40 pct of the total 10,572,402 acres accepted into the ten-year program. USDA analysts gave the following enrollment breakdown: -- wheat 2,615,140 acres -- corn 1,894,764 acres -- barley 705,888 acres -- sorghum 585,552 acres -- cotton 417,893 acres -- rice 2,035 acres -- peanuts 611 acres -- tobacco 285 acres -- total program crops 6,512,700 acres -- total nonprogram 4,059,702 acres -- total enrollment 10,572,402 acres USDA analysts are currently working on a complete state breakdown of crop acreage enrollment and should have it ready for publication later this week, they said."
pacific resources <pri> installs oil mooring,ship crude fuel,"Pacific Resources Inc said it has installed a CALM (Catenary Anchor Leg Mooring) single-point mooring terminal off the southwest coast of Oahu at its Hawaiian Independent Refinery at a cost of 3.5 mln dlrs. The system transfers crude and fuel oils from tankers to the refinery's tank farm and carries refined products to ships for export, PRI said. Company chairman Robert G. Reed said the new mooring system will permit 24-hour service in most kinds of weather and will reduce ship turnaround time. He said the mooring is the first of its kind in the U.S. The new system can accomodate vessels up to 150,000 deadweight tons, or one mln barrels of cargo, PRI said."
more ccc credit guarantees for algeria -- usda,meal-feed veg-oil,"The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) has approved an additional 84.0 mln dlrs in credit guarantees for sales of U.S. agricultural products to Algeria for fiscal year 1987 under the Export Credit Guarantee Program (GSM-102), the U.S. Agriculture Department said. The department said the additional guarantees provide up to 31.0 mln dlrs in coverage for sales of protein meals, 9.0 mln dlrs for tallow, and 44.0 mln dlrs for vegetable oils. The latest guarantees increase the cumulative fiscal 1987 program for sales of U.S. agricultural products to Algeria to 464.0 mln dlrs from 380.0, it said. To be eligible for the credit guarantees, all sales must be registered with the CCC by September 30, and shipments completed by December 31, 1987, it said."

Danforth aide Austin Schlick said the bill was similar to a provision included in a House Agriculture Committee-passed emergency disaster assistance bill scheduled to be taken up by the House tomorrow. Schlick said flooding destroyed a number of levees along the two rivers last October, leaving farmland there vulnerable to further damage this year."

The department said the sales will be subsidized with commodities from the Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC, inventory and the subsidy will enable U.S. exports to compete at commercial prices in the Algerian market. Algeria has already purchased 300,000 tonnes of U.S. durum wheat under a previous export enhancement initiative announced November 10, 1986, it said. Details of the latest initiative, including an invitation for offers from exporters, will be issued in the near future, the department said."
senate committee may look at fuel tax proposals,crude fuel,"The Senate budget committee sits down tomorrow to start drafting a fiscal 1988 budget, with the budget writers expected to look at several proposals for fuel taxes and other tax options to cut the budget. In a briefing book for the drafting sessions, a number of revenue raising tax options are proposed, including a five dlrs a barrel fee on domestic and imported oil, a fee just on imported oil, and a broad based tax on domestic energy consumption based on five pct of value. Other proposals include various excise taxes and combinations of import surcharges or tariffs, including a 10 pct import across the board import surcharge that would raise 22 billion dlrs next year alone, more in later years. The committee, however, will only include revenue numbers in its proposed budget with the actual revenue decisions left to the House and Senate tax-writing committees. The committee will draft a budget which its chairman, Sen Lawton Chiles, a Florida Democrat, said he hopes would raise at least 18 billion dlrs in revenues, or about half the minimum 36 billion dlr deficit reduction he has in mind. The House Budget Committee also plans to start drafting a separate budget plan later this week, which would have to be reconciled with the Senate version. The final budget would be the fiscal 1988 spending and revenue blueprint."

soybean groups meet with lyng to discuss loan,soybean oilseed,"A high-level meeting last week which included the Secretary of Agriculture and other senior USDA officials, along with leaders of the major soybean lobbying groups, failed to reach any decision on what should be done about the soybean loan level, participants at the meeting told Reuters. ""We didn't feel a lot was accomplished last week, but we were delighted to meet with the Secretary, and he didn't close the door on anything,"" a member of the soybean delegation said. At issue is the current soybean loan and the fact that at the present level of 4.77 dlrs (without Gramm-Rudman reductions) it encourages foreign soybean production by making soybeans more profitable to grow than corn. But while recognizing that soybeans are priced too high in relation with corn, soybean groups have pledged their support to maintaining current price supports for soybean growers. Leaders of the American Soybean Association and the National Soybean Processors Association offered specific loan options to USDA Secretary Lyng in last week's meeting, but participants would not reveal what those options were. ""There were no surprises in our package,"" one participant said. Bandied about for several weeks has been the idea of offering producers soybean loans partially in cash and in certificates. The most prevailing scheme would be to pay a 4.77 loan with 77 cts worth of soybean-specific certificates which would not have to be paid back and the remaining four dlrs in cash. This would have the effect of lowering the world price, maintaining domestic support levels and reducing the government's soybean inventory. A marketing loan for soybeans was not discussed at last week's meeting, participants said. One member of the soybean delegation said that the meeting was a ""listening session"" for USDA, and that the proposals will now be studied further by the Department. USDA officials, however, would not commit to any time frame. Participants in the meeting do not look for changes in the soybean loan to be announced in the near future. ""USDA is very sensitive about saying anything that could influence the market, so the Secretary was very non-committal,"" a participant said."
ec commission defends farm program,oilseed veg-oil,"The European Community's (EC) executive Commission defended attacks on major elements of its ambitious program to rid the EC of its controversial farm surpluses, after strong attacks from northern states. Britain and West Germany, backed by the Netherlands and Denmark, opposed a proposed tax on edible oils and fats which has already sparked strong protest from exporters to the EC led by the U.S. and from EC consumer groups, diplomats said. But EC Agriculture Commissioner Frans Andriessen told journalists he had warned ministers that failure to agree the tax, proposed last month as part of the Commission's annual farm price package, would leave a large hole in the group's budget. He added that he hoped states had not yet made their mind up for good. ""I hope the debate is still open, if not there will be a formidable hole in the budget,"" he said. The shortfall could reach two billion dollars in 1988 and would be only slightly less this year, he said. Foreign ministers were taking a first look at the tax ahead of farm ministers in a move described by diplomats as unprecedented and welcomed by Andriessen as a sign ministers recognised the importance of reforming the EC's farm policy. The proposed tax is designed to provide the EC with extra cash to finance community oilseed crops at their current levels and to brake a dramatic decrease in olive oil consumption by making it more competitive with other oils. Andriessen noted the EC has over two mln olive oil producers, mostly small farmers, who could be helped by the tax. ""What we are suggesting is reasonable, it should be better understood not just outside the community but at home,"" he said. Britain, normally a keen advocate of radical changes in the EC's costly farm subsidies system, warned the proposal to impose the tax on both domestic and imported oils and fats could seriously damage the EC's trade relations with other countries. Britain also warned that the tax could hit developing countries already receiving aid from the EC, they said. The Commission also defended proposals to dismantle Monetary Compensatory Amounts (MCA) -- a system of cross border subsidies and taxes to level out foreign exchange fluctuations for farm exports -- against harsh West German criticism. In a letter this weekend from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to EC executive Commission President, Jacques Delors, Kohl made clear such a dismantling would mainly hit West German farmers. Diplomats said West Germany again repeated its criticism at the talks here but Andriessen told journalists that Germany had been alone in its opposition. The question was a key aspect of the Commission's farm price proposals, he added. Ministers also agreed a 3.5 billion dlrs scheme to rid the EC of its butter mountain, despite Spanish and Portuguese opposition. The scheme will pay for the disposal of one mln tonnes of unwanted butter, by selling it at knock-down prices, turning it into animal feed or exporting it at subsidised prices. National capitals are due to be reimbursed later out of savings from another plan to curb milk production. Diplomats said Spain and Portugal have been angered by the scheme, which they feel forces them to pay for massive surpluses built up before they joined the community last year, but the two countries did not block today's vote."
dollar seen falling unless japan spurs economy,money-fx dlr,"Underlying dollar sentiment is bearish, and operators may push the currency to a new low unless Japan takes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the Paris accord, foreign exchange analysts polled by Reuters said here. ""The dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of 150.00 yen and to fall even below that level,"" a senior dealer at one leading bank said. The dollar has eased this week, but remains stable at around 151.50 yen. Six major industrial countries agreed at a meeting in Paris in February to foster currency stability. Some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term, but a drastic fall is unlikely because of U.S. Fears of renewed inflation and fears of reduced Japanese purchases of U.S. Treasury securities, needed to finance the U.S. Deficit. Dealers generally doubted whether any economic package Japan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce its trade surplus significantly, and said such measures would probably invite further U.S. Steps to weaken the dollar. Under the Paris accord, Tokyo promised a package of measures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boost domestic demand, increase imports and cut its trade surplus. But debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of Parliamentary business over the proposed imposition of a five pct sales tax, and the government has only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future, the dealers said. If no such steps are taken, protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress will grow, putting greater downward pressure on the dollar, they said. The factors affecting the U.S. Currency have not changed since before the Paris accord, they added. ""Underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due to a still-sluggish U.S. Economic outlook, the international debt crisis triggered by Brazil's unilateral suspension of interest payments on its foreign debts and the reduced clout of the Reagan administration as a result of the Iran/Contra arms scandal,"" said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank. ""There is a possibility that the dollar may decline to around 140.00 yen by the end of this year,"" said Chemical Bank Tokyo branch vice president Yukuo Takahashi. But operators find it hard to push the dollar either way for fear of possible concerted central bank intervention. Dealers said there were widespread rumours that the U.S. Federal Reserve telephoned some banks in New York to ask for quotes last Wednesday, and even intervened to sell the dollar when it rose to 1.87 marks. The Bank of England also apparently sold sterling in London when it neared 1.60 dlrs on Wednesday, they said. But other dealers said they doubted the efficacy of central bank intervention, saying it may stimulate the dollar's decline because many dealers are likely to await such dollar buying intervention as a chance to sell dollars. However, First National Bank of Chicago Tokyo Branch assistant manager Hiroshi Mochizuki said ""The dollar will not show drastic movement at least to the end of March."" Other dealers said the U.S. Seems unwilling to see any strong dollar swing until Japanese companies close their books for the fiscal year ending on March 31, because a weak dollar would give Japanese institutional investors paper losses on their foreign holdings, which could make them lose interest in purchases of U.S. Treasury securities. U.S. Monetary officials may refrain from making any comments this month to avoid influencing rates, they said."
market welcomes lower australian payments deficit,bop trade austdlr money-fx interest,"The Australian dollar rose more than 40 points and money market interest rates retreated on the better than expected improvement in the February current account deficit, but economists and dealers were cautious about identifying it as the start of a downward trend. The current account deficit narrowed to 750 mln dlrs in February from 1.23 billion in January. It hit 13.82 billion dlrs in 1985/86 to end-June. The currency jumped to 0.6858/63 U.S. Dlrs and traded as high as 0.6875 before retreating to around 0.6864/69. ""It's got 69 cents written all over it,"" one dealer said. Foreign exchange dealers said some buyers had gone long on the dollar expecting a lower figure and sold it down about 30 points to 0.6820 U.S. Dlrs before the release. The 750 mln dlr deficit was at the lower end of forecasts and analysts said the market would welcome any figure below one billion dlrs for March. Banque National de Paris <BNPP.A> senior dealer Peter Nicolls cautioned that in the long term the currency and interest rates were too high for import substitution and export industries. Nicolls said he expected the dollar to go as high as 0.6875 and perhaps to 69 cents tomorrow. <Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd> chief economist Will Buttrose said the 42 mln dlr trade surplus was encouraging as were imports at 2.77 billion dlrs, down from 2.99 billion in January. But he warned that the outlook for rural and iron and coal exports remained poor. ""We should remember we are paying something like seven to eight billion dollars simply to service our foreign debt and that is not going to go away in the near term,"" Buttrose said. Buttrose said he expected a March deficit of around 900 mln dlrs, and added ""Any figure under a billion dollars will be acceptable (to the markets)."" ANZ Banking Group Ltd <ANZA.S> senior economist Ian Little said the big question was whether the improvement in exports could be sustained. February FOB exports rose to 2.82 billion dlrs from a revised 2.74 billion in January. Interest rates responded quickly to the deficit news, with 90-day bank bill yields falling to 16.42-16.45 pct from early highs of 16.50 and yields yesterday as high as 16.65. Longer term yields fell with 10-year bonds at 13.66/68 pct from 13.74 before the release and highs of 13.87 yesterday. The stock market was easier at midsession but brokers said the current account data had little impact on trading."

A bank official attributed the increase mainly to Taiwan's growing trade surplus, which increased to a record 16.8 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1986 from 11.2 billion in 1985. He said the deficit on invisible trade narrowed to 740 mln U.S. Dlrs from 1.97 billion. Invisible earnings rose to 6.77 billion from 5.09 billion while invisible spending climbed to 7.51 billion from 7.06 billion, he said."
ec warns u.s. and japan on trade tensions,trade bop,"The European Community (EC) yesterday warned Japan and the United States, its main trading partners, that friction over trade issues is affecting the EC's relations with both countries. EC foreign ministers issued a statement deploring Japan's continued trade imbalance and appealed for the country to make a greater effort to open up its markets. They also said they were disturbed by a draft bill before the U.S. Congress that would impose permanent quotas on textile imports and were prepared to react. The U.S. Administration has already distanced itself from the bill. EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq has written to his U.S. Counterpart, Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, outlining the EC's concerns. The statement said ministers were very disturbed by U.S. Moves towards protectionism. ""The adoption of such measures would not fail to have a negative effect on the process of multilateral negotiations just started, as well as on bilateral relations,"" it said. Any unilateral U.S. Moves would leave the EC no option but to react according to the laws of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, it said. In a separate statement on Japan, the EC ministers said they ""deplore the continued aggravation of the imbalance in trade (and) expect Japan to open up its market more."" The statement said the EC would continue to insist that Japan boost imports and stimulate domestic demand. Ministers also called on the EC Commission to prepare a report on U.S.-Japanese trade for July this year to enable them to take appropriate action where necessary. One diplomat said the call for a report showed ministers were determined not to let the Japanese question drop. ""It will be back on the table again and again,"" the diplomat said. De Clercq, talking to journalists during the meeting, said, ""There is a certain nervousness, a growing impatience within the Community concerning trade relations with Japan."" The EC is not satisfied with Japan's inability to cut its trade surplus, and the Commission has adopted a tough approach on imports of goods such as Japanese photocopiers, where it has imposed 20 pct anti-dumping duties. But diplomats said the EC is keen to negotiate with Tokyo to solve the problem rather than embark on a costly and damaging trade war, and the ministers called for more cooperation with Japan in industry and research."

Speaking at a news conference before a scheduled speech, Lyng said he did not think the tax, which is still in the discussion stage, would be approved. He said the U.S. Would take serious retaliatory action because if implemented, the tax would have a considerable impact on U.S. Farmers."

"japan seen reducing beef, pork intervention prices",livestock carcass,"The Agriculture Ministry is expected to reduce official intervention prices for beef and pork in 1987/88 starting in April, but the cutback ratio has not been set yet, industry sources said. Production prices, the basis for setting intervention prices, have been falling because of declining compound feed prices due to low coarse grain import prices, they said. Last November an advisory panel urged the government to work on reducing officially set high farm product prices to levels closer to international values, the sources added. In Japan the government maintains a price stabilisation zone system for beef and pork to support domestic producers. The stabilisation zone is kept by the semi-government Livestock Industry Promotion Corp (LIPC) through a buffer stock operation in the wholesale market. The 1987/88 beef and pork price stabilisation zone will be set by the end of March after an advisory panel to the Agriculture Ministry recommends the price zone at a meeting on March 25, ministry officials said. At present, the standard or bottom price of castrated wagyu beef, known as marbled beef, is 1,400 yen per kilo, while its ceiling is 1,820, they said. The standard price of other beef, mainly produced from dairy steers, is now 1,090 yen per kilo and the ceiling is 1,420, the officials said. The pork standard price is now 540 yen per kilo and the ceiling 760. They said the domestic beef intervention price influences imported beef selling prices on the domestic market. Japan sets an annual beef import quota. A semi-government body imports most of this and releases it to wholesalers or processors in line with the standard price of other beef categories in an attempt to avoid jeoparadising domestic beef prices, they said."
taiwan issues more certificates of deposit,interest money-supply,"Taiwan's central bank issued 12 billion Taiwan dlrs worth of certificates of deposit after issuing six billion yesterday, bringing CD issues so far this year to 115.47 billion dlrs, a bank official told Reuters. The new CDs have maturities of six months, one year and two years and bear interest rates ranging from 4.07 pct to 5.12 pct, he said. The issues are aimed at helping curb the growth of M-1b money supply, which is the result of large foreign exchange reserves. The reserves now total more than 51 billion U.S. Dlrs."
taiwan said considering currency liberalisation,reserves money-fx,"Taiwan's central bank is considering proposals to ease currency restrictions to reduce foreign exchange reserves of 51 billion U.S. Dlrs, a local newspaper reported today. The China Times, which has close ties with the government, quoted central bank governor Chang Chi-cheng as saying the government had agreed in principle to liberalise financial restrictions. The bank was considering proposals to allow firms and individuals to hold foreign exchange and invest in foreign stocks for the first time, Chang was quoted as saying. All foreign exchange must now be handed to local banks and exchanged for local currency. Firms and individuals may only invest in foreign government bonds, treasury bills and certificates of deposit. Central bank and other government officials were not available to comment on the report. Economists said it was likely that the government would ease foreign exchange controls, but only gradually. They said vast foreign currency reserves, earned mainly from huge trade surpluses with the United States, made Taiwan a target for U.S. Protectionism. Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. Rose to 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs last year compared with 10.2 billion in 1985. ""The central bank has to go in this direction,"" said Su Han-min, chief economist with the International Commercial Bank of China. ""If they don't quicken the pace, Washington could retaliate and really damage Taiwan."""
zimbabwe maize output to fall 65 pct,corn grain,"Maize deliveries to Zimbabwe's state-owned Grain Marketing Board (GMB) will fall by over 65 pct this year, following a prolonged dry spell, agricultural industry sources said. They said 1987 maize deliveries are expected to decline to around 520,000 tonnes from 1.6 mln tonnes last year. About 60 pct of the maize will be delivered by large-scale commercial farmers and the balance by small-scale peasant producers. Although this will be the lowest level of maize deliveries since 1980, the sources said there is no danger of a food shortage in Zimbabwe. While annual maize consumption is estimated at 750,000 tonnes, the GMB stockpile is currently around 1.8 mln tonnes, which means that even with the sharply reduced production this year Zimbabwe has enough maize for the next three years. The sources said the lower maize crop would be offset by a 25 pct increase in cotton production to 315,000 tonnes from 248,000 tonnes last year, and by a rise of 20 pct in soybean deliveries to 100,000 tonnes from 84,000 tonnes in 1986."
loophole for tankers in norway's s. africa ban,ship trade crude,"Norway's parliament has approved an extensive trade ban against South Africa but left shipowners a key loophole through which controversial oil shipments on Norwegian tankers may continue, government officials said. The unilateral boycott gives domestic companies until late September to cut trade ties with South Africa and Namibia. Although forbidding crude oil shipments to South Africa on Norwegian-owned tankers, the boycott makes a crucial exception for ships whose final destination is decided while at sea. As oil cargoes are often resold after loading, critics said the door will be left open for continued shipments to South Africa. Norwegian tankers supplied South Africa with about 30 pct of its crude oil imports during the early 1980s, but the trade has dropped sharply to just one cargo in the last three months, trade ministry officials said. The latest trade figures show Norwegian imports from South Africa dropped 36 pct to 160 mln crowns during the first eight months of 1986, while exports plunged 52 pct to 265 mln crowns from the year-ago figure. The boycott legislation now goes to the upper house for formal ratification later this week, parliamentarians said."

Iranian gunboats usually check a ship's nationality and cargo before attacking but the Pivot was hit near Bu Musa island without warning, they added."
renewed bull spreading likely on cattle report,livestock l-cattle carcass,"Livestock analysts expect renewed bull spreading in live cattle futures following yesterday's USDA 7-state cattle on feed report. The USDA reported high placements in February, which may weigh on back months of cattle futures. Meanwhile, continued strong marketings during the month will support the April contract. Contracts for June delivery forward could open 25 to 50 cents lower while April will likely open about steady, analysts said. Cheap corn is still the main incentive for putting cattle on feed, according to Smith Barney livestock analyst Tom O'Hare. ""They have no place to send the grain,"" he said. Strong daily fundamentals may add to nearby support while the current discount of deferred months to the cash market may offset much of the effect of the report, analysts said. ""The cash market is strong and may overshadow the report,"" said Robin Fuller, analyst for Agri Analysis. She added that even though placements came in above the average trade guess, many traders had expected high placements. Placements are not that negative, especially since the technical correction in June and August live cattle futures since last week, GH Miller analyst Jerry Gidel said. He said the current marketing posture will provide added support to the nearby month. Feedlot marketings have been running at a heavier than expected pace. Chuck Levitt, analyst for Shearson Lehman said that with the number of cattle on feed down five pct at the beginning of the year, a three pct decline in marketings was expected. But the report for January showed marketings at 101 pct of a year ago and in February marketings were at 100 pct, Levitt noted. ""So far we haven't seen any decline in marketings. They (feedlot operators) are marketing more cattle than they had intended for the first quarter, which is a bullish development,"" Levitt said. Gidel also noted that marketings for the early part of March are running ahead of a year ago. Feedlots are not falling behind and are holding that 100 pct marketing pace."

u.s. current account deficit 36.84 billion dlrs,bop trade,"The U.S. current account deficit widened to a record 36.84 billion dlrs on a balance of payments basis in the October-December fourth quarter of 1986 from a revised 35.29 billion dlrs in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said. Previously, the department said the third-quarter deficit was 36.28 billion dlrs. For the full year 1986, the current account, a broad measure of trade performance, was in deficit a record 140.57 billion dlrs after a 117.68 billion dlr deficit in 1985. The department said an increase in the merchandise trade deficit during the fourth quarter to 38.4 billion dlrs from 37.1 billion dlrs in the third quarter was the main reason for the worsening deficit. Net service receipts declined to 5.5 billion dlrs in the final quarter from six billion dlrs in the third quarter. The current account includes trade in merchandise and services as well as U.S. financial transactions with the rest of the world. The department said the merchandise trade deficit for all of 1986 grew to 147.7 billion from 124.4 billion dlrs in 1985. Net service receipts were 22.3 billion dlrs in 1986, compared with 21.7 billion dlrs in 1985, the department said. Net unilateral transfers during the fourth quarter last year, covering foreign aid and government pensions, were down to 3.9 billion dlrs from 4.2 billion dlrs in the third quarter because of fewer U.S. government grants to Mideast countries. Liabilities to foreigners reported by U.S. banks rose 35.3 billion dlrs between October and December after increasing 30.1 billion dlrs in the third quarter. For the full year, these liabilities grew 77.4 billion dlrs after rising by 40.4 billion dlrs in 1985. The department said inflows were boosted in the fourth quarter by international activities of Japanese banks and strong demand within the United States to finance acquisitions. Net foreign sales of U.S. Treasury securities by foreigners were 2.7 billion dlrs in the quarter after purchases of 500 mln dlrs in the third quarter. Net foreign purchases of securities other than U.S. Treasury securities in the fourth quarter were 11.8 billion dlrs, compared with 17.2 billion dlrs in the third quarter. For all 1986, foreign purchases of securities excluding U.S. Treasury securities were a record 70.7 billion dlrs, surpassing the previous record 50.9 billion dlr total in 1985. Claims on foreigners reported by U.S. banks in the fourth quarter rose 29.9 billion dlrs after a 19.3 billion dlr third-quarter increase. U.S. sales of foreign securities rose to 2.7 billion dlrs from 300 mln dlrs in the third quarter because of a sharp selloff of foreign stocks and bonds, the department said. Outflows for U.S. direct investment abroad fell to 5.7 billion dlrs from eight billion dlrs in the third quarter. Foreign direct investment in the United States increased 14.4 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter, compared with 5.6 billion dlrs in the previous quarter, because of stepped-up acquisitions, the department said. Foreign official assets in the United States increased 800 mln dlrs between October and December after rising 15.4 billion dlrs in the third quarter. For the full year 1986, foreign official assets grew 33.4 billion dlrs after a 1985 decrease of 1.9 billion dlrs as foreign monetary authorities intervened heavily in exchange markets late in the year as the dollar fell, commerce said."
kansas legislator to offer u.s. 0/92 bill today,grain wheat,"U.S. Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., chairman of the House Agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains, said he would today introduce a bill to apply the so-called 0/92 concept to wheat and feedgrains producers. Glickman told Reuters the measure would allow 1987 winter wheat producers and 1988 feedgrains producers the possibility of receiving no less than 92 pct of their income support payments regardless of how much acreage they planted. He also said his bill would protect program participants from reduced income payments in the event market prices rose above the loan rate."
u.k. growth rate seen at three pct this year,gnp bop,"Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, presenting his budget for fiscal 1987/88 to parliament, said U.K. Economic growth was forecast at three pct in calendar 1987. He said the Treasury expected a current account balance of payments deficit in 1987 of 2.5 billion stg, after a 1.1 billion shortfall in 1986. Inflation is expected to be 4.0 pct at the end of 1987, he said, adding it may exceed 4.5 pct by the summer before falling back to 4.0 pct by the end of the year. The planned PSBR for 1987/88 was 4.0 billion stg unchanged when compared with the likely outturn for fiscal 1986/87, Lawson said. Although no explicit target was set for the broad sterling M3 money supply, Lawson said broad money will continue to be taken into account in assessing monetary conditions as well as the exchange rate. The low outturn of the PSBR in 1986/87 was mainly due to the buoyancy of non-oil tax revenues in general, and the corporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable business sector in particular. On oil prices, Lawson said he was sticking to his earlier assumption that North Sea crude prices will average 15 dlrs per barrel in calendar 1987. The treasury would strive to keep the PSBR at 1.0 pct of GDP in future, he said."
fed adds reserves via customer repurchases,money-fx interest,"The Federal Reserve entered the U.S. Government securities market to arrange two billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements, a Fed spokesman said.

italy stance on ec oils tax not encouraging-asa,veg-oil soybean,"Italy's response to protests by U.S. Soybean producers about the proposed European Community (EC) tax on vegetable oils and fats had not been encouraging, American Soybean Association (ASA) board chairman George Fluegel said. Fluegel, heading one of three U.S. Soybean producer delegations currently on a lobbying tour of EC countries, told Reuters in an interview meetings with officials from the Italian Foreign and Agricultural ministries had not yielded much to encourage hopes that Italy would vote against the proposed tax. Fluegel said his delegation had received a negative response from the Italian Agriculture Ministry, but that the attitude of the Foreign Ministry appeared ""more realistic."" He said the proposed tax was discriminatory against U.S. Farmers since it was basically asking them to help finance the EC's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) on oilseeds. Asked which EC countries might be expected to vote against the proposed tax, he said, ""Realistically, from the information we're getting, it looks like the English, the Germans, hopefully the Netherlands and Denmark."" His delegation also hoped to convince Belgium to vote against the issue, he added. Asked what form he thought U.S. Retaliatory action might take in the event of the EC tax proposal being approved, Fluegel said industrial as well as agricultural products could be involved. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng warned the EC yesterday it would face serious retaliation if it enacted the tax. ASA president-elect Wayne Bennett said yesterday in The Hague American soybean producers were confident the proposed tax would be rejected."
u.s. house targeting proposal sparks interest,grain wheat,"A proposal by two U.S. House Democrats to target government farm benefits to small- and medium-sized farms was warmly received by Democrats on a House subcommittee today. ""On balance, this is the best new idea I have seen,"" said Rep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.), Chairman of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Wheat, Feedgrains and Soybeans. ""This is the first hard constructive proposal coming out as an alternative to the (Reagan) administration's farm proposal."" The plan, offered by Reps. Tim Penny (D-Minn.) and Byron Dorgan (D-ND), would raise target prices for wheat to 5.00 dlrs per bushel and for corn to 3.50 dlrs. Producers could receive deficiency payments on up to 80 pct of normal yield but not more than on 30,000 bu of corn and 20,000 bu of wheat. The proposal also would require acreage reductions of 20 pct, eliminate generic certificates and prohibit persons not actively engaged in farming from receiving program benefits. Dorgan said the bill would save 24 billion dlrs over five years, protect family farms and eliminate government accumulation of stocks because nonrecourse loans would be halted. However, Rep. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) said the measure would ""involve the federal government in deciding and defining who a family farmer is."" Roberts said the bill, for example, would restrict program payments to 500 acres of wheat production in western Kansas. Other Republicans on the panel questioned how the bill would determine if a person was actively engaged in farming and therefore eligible for payments."
ec to mull new durum wheat intervention rules,grain wheat,"The European Commission is to consider proposed new higher minimum standards for sales of durum wheat into intervention stores, European Community sources said. They said a document drawn up by Commission officials proposes a reduction in the maximum humidity level to 13 pct from 14, an increase in the minimum weight to 78 kilos per hectolitre from 76, a tightening of other technical standards and introduction of some new ones. Current public stocks of durum wheat in the EC are 1.15 mln tonnes, of which almost 1.12 mln are in Italy."
"dollar value appropriate, bundesbank official says",dlr money-fx,"The dollar is near appropriate levels against European currencies and the yen, and a further fall could damage confidence in the currency while endangering world economic growth, a top Bundesbank official said. Board member Leonhard Gleske also told a Forex Association conference current exchange rates of major currencies ""can be viewed as equilibrium levels in a medium-term perspective."" He said the recent Paris agreement on currency stabilisation and policy coordination between the Group of Five and Canada may herald ""an era of greater exchange rate stability."" The Paris agreement was not, however, an attempt to set up permanent target zones for exchange rates, Gleske stressed, adding such targets would be extremely difficult to agree and enforce on an international level. ""At present levels the dollar can no longer be considered grossly overvalued in relation to the European currencies and the yen,"" Gleske said. He said the dollar had fallen much less against currencies of important trading nations such as Canada, Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong, and further falls there may still be necessary. But ""a further dollar depreciation against major European currencies and the yen may not be the best way to restore the dollar to a fully competitive position, as measured by its weighted external value,"" he said. In fact, a further marked decline in the dollar rate would hold two major dangers, Gleske said. First, in countries with large balance of payments surpluses such as Japan and West Germany, it threatened to hamper economic growth and thus slow down the expansion of real income and domestic expenditure necessary to wipe out surpluses. Second, in the United States, it could damage investors' confidence in the dollar and thus reduce their willingness to finance huge fiscal and external payments deficits, Gleske said. Gleske also was strongly sceptical that an international system of binding target zones for currencies, fluctuating in narrow bands against each other, can be established. Such targets threatened to cause policy conflicts, ""both within countries and between them."" For instance, the U.S. Reliance on foreign capital to fund its deficits requires interest rates there be set at high levels, but domestic considerations call for low ones. If target zones were established, this would put ""pressure on other countries to reduce their interest rates even more, even though this may be in conflict with their own domestic situation and priorities,"" he said. Gleske added, ""targeting the exchange rate even within a wide margin will meet with serious objections where there is a clearly perceived potential for conflict between domestic and external policy priorities."" Commenting on the Paris currency accord, Gleske said its chances of stabilising exchange rates rested heavily on current interest rate differentials being maintained. These chances ""seem to me to rest critically on the expectation that the current configuration of interest rates, and the monetary policies behind them, will assure smooth financing of current account imbalances in the months ahead."" Gleske said past experience of currency adjustments had learned ""that markets are inclined to be impatient and will thus tend to overshoot."" He said this ""would seem to be unnecessary and should be avoided if at all possible."" Monetary policies can help achieve this, but only if markets believe that pledged changes in fiscal policies will lead to balanced international payments, he said."
china crop weather summary -- usda/noaa,grain wheat rice,"Light, scattered showers covered winter wheat areas in the North China Plain in the week ended March 14, moistening topsoils for wheat, just breaking dormancy in most central and northern areas, the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility of the U.S. Agriculture and Commerce Departments said. In its International Weather and Crop summary, the agency said southern winter wheat areas are in the early vegetative stage. Above-normal February temperatures over the North China Plain caused winter grains to break dormancy early in the south. Moderate to heavy rains in southern Jiangsu, Anhui, eastern Hebei, Hunan , Jiangxi, Fujian, and Zheziang, reversed February's below normal precipitation pattern. The agency said the wet weather in these areas provided ample moisture for rice planting and lessened the need for irrigation. Mostly dry weather in early-rice areas of Guanxi and Guandong resulted in irrigation for continued rice planting, it said."
brazil crop weather summary -- usda/noaa,oilseed soybean,"Wet weather covered Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil in the week ended March 14, benefitting soybeans which are mostly setting to filling pods, the Joint Agricultural weather Facility of the U.S. Agriculture and Commerce Departments said. In its International Weather and Crop Summary, the agency said minimal precipitation covered soybean areas in Santa Catarina, Parana, and southern Matto Grosso do Sul. Adequate soil moisture in these areas met crop moisture demands, reducing the potential for crop stress, it said. The agency said February precipitation was above normal over most soybean areas of Brazil. Weekly temperatures were below normal, it said."
"lyng to meet with exporters, eep likely topic",grain wheat,"Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng will meet with representatives from major grain exporting companies today, and the subject of subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union will likely be discussed, an aide to Lyng said. Today's meeting, set to begin at 1500 EST (2000 gmt), was scheduled at the request of the exporters, the aide said. ""The EEP (export enhancement program) is pretty obviously one of the things they (the exporters) want to talk about, but they haven't any agenda as far as I know,"" Lyng's aide said. Private industry export officials have met periodically with Lyng to discuss farm policies and the export situation. Whether this meeting will prompt any U.S. action on the issue of whether Moscow will be offered export bonus wheat is uncertain, the aide said. ""I don't know what they'll tell us that we don't already knwo, but we'll hear what they have to say,"" Lyng's aide said. The USDA official said that as far as he knows there has been no further action on offering the Soviet Union wheat under the EEP."
south africa crop weather summary -- usda/noaa,grain corn,"Dry weather pushed further into South Africa's Orange Free State's Maize Triangle in the week ended March 14, the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility of the U.S. Agriculture and Commerce Departments said. In a summary of its Weather and Crop Bulletin, the agency said scattered showers continued throughout Transvaal, but dry pockets persisted in the northeast and south. Temperatures average one to four degrees C above normal throughout all grain areas, stressing grain-filling corn in areas receiving lightest rainfall, it said. The agency said rainfall during February was near to above normal in most areas, but earlier periods of hot, dry weather reduced yield prospects in parts of the northern Transvaal and southern Orange Free State."
world crop weather summary -- usda/noaa,grain wheat rice,"Dry weather covered most European crop areas in the week ended March 14, except for those in southwestern France, southern Italy, and Greece, the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility of the U.S. Agriculture and Commerce Departments said. In its International Weather and Crop sumary, the agency said mixed rain and snow covered Greece. Winter grains in England, France, and northern Italy remained dormant. Grains usuaually break dormancy in March. Winter grains in Eastern Europe usually break dormancy in early April, it said. Showers improved irrigation supplies in winter wheat areas of northern Pakistan and northern India, it said. Normally, wheat harvesting is well underwaty in central India and just beginnning to the north, ending in most areas by late April. Showers improved irrigation supplies in southern India, reversing February's below-normal trend. Summer rice is usually in or nearing reproduction in most southern areas, it said. In the Philippines, most rainfall was restricted to the central islands, continuing February's drying trend in Luzon and southern Mindanao. Locally heavy showers dotted Indonesia and Malaysia as rainfall generally decreased eastward through the islands. In February locally heavy showers may have caused flooding in Java, it said. The second cnsecutive week of dry weather stressed Moroccan winter grains, approaching teh heading stage, the agency said. Light to moderate rain spread from northern Thailand to Northern Vietnam as dry weather prevailed elsewhere in Southeast Asia. Dry weather covered winter grain areas in western and central Algeria, but soil moisture was likely adequate to meet crop demands, it said. Light showers in eastern Algeria and Tunisia maintained adequate moisture for crop growth, it said. Timely rains will be needed in the next several weeks as winter grains advance through the critical reproductive phase, the agency said."
analysts say u.k. budget points to base rate cuts,interest bop money-supply,"Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's Budget speech was described as sound and well balanced by analysts, if slightly lacking in excitement. A cut in bank base lending rates is now widely expected tomorrow, with most forecasts predicting a half-point fall. A follow-up half-point cut is anticipated next week. ""Worthy but boring would probably sum it up,"" Peter Fellner, U.K. Economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co, said. ""It was a very, very prudent fiscal budget."" Richard Jeffrey of brokers Hoare Govett said it was a well-balanced budget within the confines of the government's philosophy of keeping expenditure levels flat. Most analysts said the Budget was very sound on the fiscal side, but offered nothing new on monetary policy. As was widely expected, Lawson split his ""fiscal adjustment"" between trimming the 1987/88 PSBR target to 4.0 billion stg from 7.1 billion and cutting basic rate income tax from 29 to 27 pct. The target for the narrow measure of money supply, M0, was kept unchangd at two to six pct, while the target for the broad Sterling M3 aggregate was dropped. Both Jeffrey and Fellner said the budget clears the way for a half-point fall in U.K. Base rates tomorrow, but the authorities are unlikely to sanction a larger cut immediately. Many analysts and currency dealers have forecast a full one-point cut tomorrow. ""The Bank of England will be loathe to take any action which it will have to reverse later,"" Jeffrey said, though he added a further half-point cut was quite possible in the near future. The main worry from today's speech is the outlook for inflation, given the signs of relaxed monetary policy contained in it, Scrimgeour Vickers economist Richard Holt said. Holt noted the ""rather loose"" inflation forecast of 4.0 pct at end-1987, and said the lower interest rates likely to result from the tough fiscal stance could cause longer term concern. ""A higher PSBR target could be preferable in the long term,"" he said, although lower mortgage interest rates on the back of falling base rates would have an offsetting impact on inflation. The Budget will inspire a lot of short-term confidence but it was ""not a good budget for inflation,"" he said Jeffrey said he would have liked Lawson to say more about the dangers of excessive liquidity build-up but overall was not too concerned about a revival of inflation. Fellner noted that the exchange rate was to remain the ""leading edge"" of monetary policy, but said the authorities were likely to be extremely cautious on this front. He said they were unlikely to hesitate in holding interest rates steady or even raising them again if sterling showed any signs of excessive weakness. Most analysts agreed Lawson had bolstered the credibility of the Budget by adopting realistic forecasts. Raising the forecast for the current account deficit from 1.5 to 2.5 billion stg for 1987 would not unsettle the markets, which are already discounting that amount, Jeffrey said. that the 4.0 billion stg PSBR target was given credibility by the favourable outturn for 1986/87, which is now also forecast to be 4.0 billion stg. But analysts said the Budget speech did not give any clear-cut indication about the timing of the general election, which has to be held before June, 1988. Some believe it signals a poll this June, noting that the benefits, such as income tax cuts and the decision not to raise duties on alcohol and tobacco, become available immediately. But others said it kept several options open and it was not possible to deduce too much from it. James Capel's Fellner noted that by being fiscally prudent, Lawson had kept open the possibility of an autumn election in that there would be no ""chickens coming home to roost."" Richard Jeffrey, who favours the likelihood of a June election, said it was important the Chancellor had not gone for a Budget aimed overtly at buying an election victory. Nevertheless, he said, it was likely to result in a boost to the Conservative Party's pre-election popularity."
bank of france sees continued industrial pickup,ipi jobs,"The Bank of France expects a continued revival in short-term industrial activity, but the outlook for any improvement in France's record 10.9 pct unemployment rate remains bleak, the Bank of France said in its monthly review. The upturn in activity in all industrial sectors except the agro-food sector in February more than compensated for the fall in January, while construction and civil engineering experienced a recovery which appears likely to extend over the next few months. Internal demand rose and the export situation improved, in particular toward the European Community (EC), the Bank said. Stocks decreases and order book levels, with the exception of the agro-food industry, improved substantially. In addition, retail prices and salaries stabilised last months. Production rose in all sectors except agricultural machinery and aeronautics, where it stabilised, and ship construction, where it declined. The car industry was the major beneficiary of the upturn in activity in February, with both domestic and export orders rising. In the consumer goods sector, actitity rose sharply despite a fall in the household goods sector and stability in pharmaceuticals. Among semi-finished products, output rose sharply, helped by a strong growth in construction materials. But activity in the retail sector declined slightly over the past two months."
u.s. housing data fail to clarify economic path,housing interest gnp,"Surprisingly strong U.S. housing statistics for February cannot be taken as an indication that the economy is generating any momentum and are not sufficient cause to start lifting forecasts for first quarter growth, economists said. Building was boosted by two factors last month, unusually mild weather and low mortgage rates. But economists said that seasonal factors make it hard to assess what spur to the economy, if any, will come from housing in coming months. And after a steady retreat, mortgage rates seem to be near bottom. U.S. housing starts rose 2.6 pct in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.851 mln units from 1.804 mln in January. It was the highest pace for starts since April 1986. The rate at which permits were issued for future building climbed 4.4 pct to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.764 mln units after dropping 11.52 pct to 1.690 mln in January. ""February's weather is usually more adverse for home building. Because of seasonal factors it's difficult to determine what this means for the economy down the road,"" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp. The housing report is seasonally-weighted to compensate for weather-related setbacks. As a result, milder temperatures inflate the statistics. Economists said that low mortgage rates also were a spur to building last month. But several believe that rates will now consolidate before edging up in late spring/early summer. ""Builders are looking at current mortgage rates and saying 'Let's do it now',"" said Mark Obrinsky of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions in Washington, whose members supply much of the financing for home building. But Obrinsky doubts that there is much more downward potential for rates because he foresees higher inflation and some overall improvement in the U.S. economy. He expects rates to gain 50 to 100 basis points in early summer from the 9.50 pct fixed rate effective in February. Last November, fixed rate mortgages were about 10.30 pct. As expected, the strength in housing was concentrated in the single-family sector. The multi-family area -- which typically represents rental units -- remained weak due to high vacancy rates and increased capital costs of such units following tax law changes effective January 1. Single-family starts rose at a 5.6 pct annual pace to 1.317 mln units. Multi-family fell 4.1 pct to a 534,000 rate. ""Strength in the single-family sector indicates that low mortgage rates are doing their job. But we're probably not looking at a great deal of growth potential,"" said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. McCarthy noted that the housing report, together with larger than expected gains in U.S. employment, industrial output and retail sales in February, may cause some observers to start waving ""four pct GNP banners"" for the first quarter. Gross national product grew 1.3 pct in the fourth quarter. But McCarthy, who still expects first quarter real GNP to come in at an annual rate of 2.5 pct or slightly above, is not convinced that growth will pick up in future. ""The big story is the inventory re-building that's going on now, not all of which is intentional,"" he said. For example, U.S. automakers, who are already saddled with high stocks, produced at an annual rate of 8.3 mln units in February compared with domestic car sales of 7.3 mln. Thus while inventories could contribute to GNP in the first quarter, they may result in scaled-back production and weaker growth in the second, he said. ""If most of the first quarter growth is inventory building and we cannot identify any improvement in export demand, then there is the potential for softness in the second quarter,"" agreed Allan Leslie of Discount Corp. He is still evaluating first quarter GNP prospects. Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker said last week that current data do not show the worsening in trade has reversed. ""At the same time that we are pumping up inventories in the first quarter, we could foresee production slowing in the second,"" cautioned Joe Plocek of McCarthy, Crisanti and Maffei Inc, who expects first quarter growth of about three pct."
u.s. house approves pilot 0/92 disaster program,grain wheat,"The House of Representatives approved a bill to enable 1987 winter wheat and feedgrains farmers hit by midwestern flooding last year to receive at least 92 pct of their federal income support payments even if they did not plant. The one-time pilot 0/92 program, designed to assist farmers in Kansas, Oklahoma, Michigan and parts of Missouri, was passed by a 304-100 vote and sent to the Senate. Although the bill includes a narrow version of the 0/92 provision endorsed by the Reagan administration, the U.S. Agriculture Department withheld its support from the measure. USDA said the bill would discourage farmers from buying crop insurance and fall short of the administration's proposed broad-scale revision of farm programs. The bill would permit winter wheat producers prevented from planting their 1987 crop last fall to receive 92 pct of the deficiency payments they would have received. To be eligible, winter wheat farmers could not plant a different crop on that land this spring, although they could use the land for grazing or to plant hay. USDA estimated this provision would save 30 mln dlrs, largely because of reduced crop forfeitures. The bill also would aid about 200 feedgrains producers along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers who were prevented from planting crops this year because of residual damage from last fall's flooding. In addition, the measure would require USDA to make full payment to farmers eligible for emergency assistance approved by Congress last fall. Currently, because claims have outstripped the 400 mln dlrs in appropriated funds, USDA plans to offer farmers in the region 74 cents for every dollar in disaster losses. The administration said it opposed the bill because, by expanding the 400 mln dlrs in disaster relief, it would thwart efforts to encourage farmers to buy crop insurance as an alternative to federal disaster assistance. USDA also said the 0/92 provisions in the bill were narrower than the administration's proposal to offer the option to all major commodities and would produce insignificant savings. USDA said the 0/92 option for 1987 winter wheat farmers would produce a net savings of about 30 mln dlrs, while the requirement to compensate fully disaster-struck farmers would cost about 135 mln dlrs, which must be appropriated by Congress. The feedgrains provision would cost about five mln dlrs. USDA estimated the overall cost of the bill to be 111 mln dlrs. In January the Senate approved a bill that would make 1987 winter wheat farmers eligible for disaster assistance payments. But the Senate bill would not offer the 0/92 option to wheat and feedgrains producers or raise the 400-mln dlr ceiling on the disaster assistance program."
honduras authorized to buy pl 480 commodities,grain wheat corn,"Honduras has been authorized to buy about 75,000 tonnes of U.S. wheat, about 15,000 tonnes of U.S. corn, and about 6,000 tonnes of U.S. tallow under an existing PL 480 agreement, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. The department said it may buy the wheat, valued at 8.5 mln dlrs, the corn, valued at 1.5 mln, and the tallow, valued at 2.0 mln dlrs, between March 24 and August 31, 1987, and ship it from U.S. ports and/or Canadian transshipment points by this September 30. The purchase authorizations cover the entire quantity provided under the agreement, signed March 11."

The marketing year for corn began September 1. This is the second day running that exporters have reported corn sales to unknown destinations. Yesterday, they reported sales of 150,000 tonnes to unknown."
uk trade wary of higher ec grain levy,trade grain,"The European Community may decide to increase the cereals co-responsibility levy and extend its scope to cover cereal substitutes if the Commission's 1987/88 farm price package is opposed by member states, Edgar Pye, vice-president of the British agricultural merchants' association UKASTA, said. At the moment the Commission is proposing the rate of levy remain unchanged at three pct - but Pye, addressing a feed manufacturers' dinner in Glasgow, said this could change if its controversial plans to cut cereal prices and introduce an oils and fats tax are blocked Pye said UKASTA would continue to fight the cereals levy ""tooth and nail."" However, a test case in the European Court of Justice contesting the legality of the current regulation applying the levy, which is being backed by the EC feed manufacturers' organisation FEFAC, was not now expected to be heard until the end of 1987, he said."
u.s. certificates to provide wheat/corn supplies,grain wheat corn,"From April through December 1986, the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) issued 3.85 billion dlrs worth of generic certificates and about 1.8 billion had not been exchanged by January 1, 1987, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. The department said an additional 4.3 billion dlrs in certificates has been authorized for issuance during January-August, 1987. These certificates will provide ample free supplies of corn and wheat for the remainder of the crop year, the department said in a summary of its Agricultural Outlook report. Freeing of stocks through certificates is making U.S. grain more competitive on world markets, it said. The department said last summer, for example, certificates were exchanged for 215 mln bushels of corn. This helped increase marketable supplies, so farm-level corn prices averaged about two dlrs per bushel -- somewhat lower than they would have otherwise. The lower prices probably led to an increase in usage of 40 to 50 mln bushels, it said. The department said government spending on farm programs in fiscal year 1987 is projected to fall half a billion dlrs from 1986's 25.8 billion dlrs. During 1988 and 1989, the cost escalation of the first half of the 1980's will reverse. If current policy remains in force, annual farm program spending by 1992 will be down from last year's record by more than eight billion dlrs, it said. The department said the President's budget proposals for 1988-1992 would cut farm program spending an additional 24 billion dlrs. In 1987, foreign economic growth is expected to remain close to 2.6 pct, the same as in 1986, but above the 2.4 pct average of 1980-86, it said. Partially because of this improvement, U.S. export volume is expected to rise in fiscal 1987 for the frist time in seven years, the department said."
farm program changes outlined by usda official,grain oilseed soybean,"Upcoming changes being considered in the U.S. Agriculture Department's transportation and loan programs were outlined by a USDA official today. Addressing the annual meeting of the National Grain and Feed Association, Tom VonGarlem, assistant deputy administrator for USDA's state and county operations, said the following changes are under consideration by USDA. Termination of USDA's Transportation Assistance Program for wheat, barley and sorghum would be proposed this week. Changes in USDA's reserve rotation program are also under consideration, VonGarlem said. While the department has not made any final decision, banning the use of pik and roll grain in reserve rotation is under heavy consideration, he said. Changes in loan rates will definitely be looked at for next year's crop, he said, with the option of making soybean loans partially in cash and in certificates under consideration. VanGarlem said he will definitely not extend the 1987 crop program signup, saying he sees no reason to do so at this time. He also said wheat will not be considered for a cash bonus under the Conservation Reserve Program."
major u.s. farm groups oppose policy changes,grain oilseed soybean carcass corn cotton rice,"Seven major U.S. farm groups took the unusual step of releasing a joint statement urging congressional leaders not to tinker with existing farm law. Following meetings with House Agriculture Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza (D-Tex.) and Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the groups issued a statement saying lawmakers should ""resist efforts to overhaul the 15-month-old law, which is operating in its first crop marketing year."" The farm groups included the American Farm Bureau Federation, American Soybean Association, National Cattlemen's Association, National Corn Growers Association, National Cotton Council, National Pork Producers Council and the U.S. Rice Producers Legislative Group. The statement said Congress should not modify the 1985 farm bill ""so the law might have its intended impact of making agriculture more competitive in export markets while at the same time maintaining farm income."" ""We strongly believe American farmers now need predictability and certainty in farm legislation in order to have any opportunity of making proper production and marketing decisions,"" the groups said."
congressman urges wheat eep to soviet union,grain wheat,"Kansas Republican Congressman Pat Roberts urged the Reagan administration to offer export enhancement program, eep, subsidies to the Soviet Union. Speaking at a House foreign agriculture subcommittee, Roberts said the U.S. has offered eep to China and Poland, and should also include the Soviet Union. Rep. Roberts said there had been some talk that the issue of an eep to Moscow had not been raised within the Reagan administration recently because Secretary of State George Shultz was out of the country. ""That very well may be the case,"" said Tom Kay, U.S. Agriculture Department Foreign Agricultural Service administrator. However, Kay told Reuters later that his reply to Roberts was not based on any particular knowledge. Rep. Roberts urged Kay to convey to top officials of the USDA that some in Congress favor a wheat eep to Moscow. ""I'd be delighted to deliver the message,"" Kay replied. Earlier, Kay had repeated Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng's statement last week that ""the door is not yet closed on an eep to the Soviet Union."""
lyng said to have no comment on ussr wheat eep,grain wheat,"U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng told representatives of several of the largest grain exporting firms and two farm organizations that he was not in a position to comment on their request that the Reagan administration offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union, according to participants in today's meeting. ""He (Lyng) simply told us he was not in any position to talk about an EEP (export enhancement program) initiative to the Soviet Union,"" said Glen Hofer, vice president of the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives. Another participant in the meeting, who asked not to be identified, said Lyng was ""unresponsive"" to the group's request. Participants in the meeting included Cargill Inc, Continental Grain Co, Louis Dreyfus Corp, Union Equity Cooperative Exchange, the National Association of Wheat Growers, the National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, among others, participants said. Deputy Agriculture Secretary Peter Myers and Under Secretary Daniel Amstutz also attended the 30-minute meeting. Hofer described Lyng as ""sympathetic but noncommittal,"" and said he thought he detected ""a sense of frustration"" on Lyng's part at not being able to respond more positively to the group's urging. A grain industry representative said some participants were ""puzzled"" by USDA's apparent reluctance to bring before the cabinet council an EEP wheat offer to the Soviets. ""There is a feeling that there is more receptivity (to the idea) within the cabinet council now than there ever has been,"" this official, who asked not to be identified, said, referring to an EEP wheat offer to the Soviets. This official said there was not a significant amount of pressure being exerted by lawmakers on Lyng to make an EEP offer to Moscow. Reminded that Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) had written two letters to Lyng urging such an offer, this official said Lyng had received virtually no phone calls from lawmakers on the subject. But Hofer said other important matters at the White House, rather than an absence of political pressure, might have restrained Lyng."
yen usurps godzilla as japan's favourite horror,money-fx yen,"""Endaka,"" the strong yen, has usurped ""Godzilla Versus the Sea Monster"" as Japan's favourite horror story. The yen's 40 pct surge against the dollar over the last two years has frightened foreigners with tales of the 40 dlr melon, the 120 dlr taxi ride from the airport and rents of 15,000 dlrs a month. But ""endaka,"" like many Japanese products, is for foreign consumption, locals and long-time foreign residents said. ""It's not really that expensive. I don't pay attention to the cost of living,"" said Cheryl Richmond, a 25-year-old Canadian teacher of English in Tokyo. Richmond said she earns 1,635 dlrs a month by ""chatting"" 40 hours a week in English to Japanese who hope to learn the language. For 326 dlrs a month she rents a sunny, quiet two-room flat some 20 minutes by train from Shinjuku, one of Tokyo's prime business and entertainment districts, and has managed to send home an average of 320 dlrs a month. She spends less than 6.50 dlrs a day on food despite eating out once a day. ""For lunch I buy the teishoku (daily special) which comes with soba (buckwheat noodles) or pork cutlet, pickles, miso soup, rice and tea,"" although she takes only coffee for breakfast and a sandwich for dinner. No one argues that Tokyo is cheap, but long-time residents see no need to spend the 2,000 to 15,000 dlrs a month spent by foreign firms to house executives in Western-style homes. The companies feel otherwise. They say they must pay the price to bring over the best people needed to back up their push into Japan's increasingly lucrative markets. ""You can't expect people to move from New York or Sydney and trade down. It's not reasonable,"" said a spokesman for International Business Machines Corp (IBM), which supports Western lifestyles for more than 350 foreigners in Tokyo. Tokyo is the world's most expensive city for business travellers, a survey issued this month by Employment Conditions Abroad said. It found that businessmen visiting Tokyo spend on average more than 300 dlrs a day. While the businessmen have little choice but to come here, many tourists, especially those from Europe, are opting to visit sunnier and cheaper climes in Southeast Asia. The Japan Tourist Bureau estimates ""endaka"" caused an 11.5 pct drop in the number of foreign visitors to Japan last year. Those who came tried to cut back on expenses, chiefly by curtailing shopping, it said. To help combat ""endaka"" and the slump in tourism, the Tourist Bureau prepared a pamphlet, ""Economical Travel in Japan."" It gives budget-saving tips on finding medium-priced business hotels and Japanese-style inns, cheap sushi and public baths while getting a ""revealing glimpse of Japanese in their daily lives."" Residents of Okubo House, a transit hotel in Tokyo's Shin-Okubo love hotel district, offer even more savvy advice. For 9.80 dlrs a night, Scott Perry, a 23-year-old budding English teacher from New Zealand, shares an unheated, berth-sized twin-room in the Japanese ""flop house."" Perry has budgeted 26 to 33 dlrs a day while he looks for work. ""Normally I eat 'teishoku' for 400 yen but sometimes I'll splurge at Shakey's where for 550 yen you can eat unlimited pizza for at least two hours."" Still, there are the extras that dent the budget. ""I had to spend 600 yen today to dry-clean my suit coat,"" he said."

It will supply 100,000 tonnes at a rate of 96.92 U.S. Dlrs a tonne as a first consignment by April 7. It will supply the remaining 100,000 tonnes at a rate of 93.42 dlrs by April 16."
"indonesia to import palm oil, fears may shortage",veg-oil palm-oil,"Indonesia has issued licences to traders to import palm oil to avert a possible shortage of cooking oil during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan in May, Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh told Reuters. ""We have given permission for a small amount of imports to prevent a shortage during Ramadan,"" he said. He gave no figures for the amount of palm oil to be imported, but said it would come from Malaysia. Indonesia, the world's second largest palm oil producer, earlier denied it had granted palm oil import licences. Saleh was replying to a question from Reuters after traders in London said Indonesia had issued licences to import around 135,000 tonnes of palm oil for delivery in April. Indonesia, with 168 mln people, is the world's largest Moslem country. During Ramadan Moslems fast during the day and have large meals after sunset. Indonesian crude palm oil exports in the first 11 months of 1986 were 469,100 tonnes, according to central bank figures, against 652,000 tonnes in the whole of calendar 1985. Indonesia is expanding palm oil output, and Saleh did not explain why there might be a shortage during Ramadan."

Palm kernel stocks dropped to an estimated 45,870 tonnes in February from a revised 55,693 (65,100) in January and 85,595 in February last year, it said."
global trading in yen bond futures expected soon,money-fx yen,"Global trading of yen bond futures is just around the corner and they are expected to be listed soon on the London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE) and the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), bond managers said. ""Internationalisation of the yen through expansion of overseas portfolios in yen assets is the key to the success of global trading of yen bond futures,"" said Katsuyuki Okayasu, general manager of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's bond division. ""But Tokyo-based orders are necessary for a primary stimulus for the LIFFE yen bond futures market,"" said Tetsuya Dezuka, deputy general manager of the money market section of New Japan Securities Co Ltd, one of the most active yen bond brokers in London. Healthy growth of yen bond futures markets depends basically on substantial liquidity in cash yen bond markets overseas and on the yen becoming attractive to traders there, dealers said. Outstanding yen cash bonds worldwide stand at around 140,000 billion yen, with most held in Japan, they said. An agreement between CBOT and LIFFE in early February on mutual settlements is expected to link U.S. Treasury bond futures trading in London and Chicago, enabling a continuous 12-hour session, bond managers here said, adding the move was made with yen bond futures trading in mind. LIFFE is preparing for an early listing of yen bond futures after receiving approval from Japan's Finance Ministry last December. But futures markets will never take root unless they are backed by substantial liquidity in cash bond markets, dealers said. Daily transactions in the London yen cash bond market now stand at 200 to 300 billion yen, but the extent of investor- linked transactions is unknown, securities bond managers said. ""Japanese corporations have been actively setting up their financing companies in London, suggesting they increasingly are engaging in, not only fund raising, but management there,"" Dezuka said. The steep increase in the number of branches of Japanese securities houses in London and the growing numbers of U.S. And U.K. Brokers coming to Tokyo has helped the London market's growth, dealers said. Internationalisation of the yen is also likely to be promoted by yen bond trading in Chicago and New York later this year, securities managers said. The recent removal of a key regulatory obstacle by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will allow the CBOT to apply to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for a yen bond futures contract, they said. The ruling removed a regulation which prohibited trading futures of designated foreign government debt securities not located in the issuing country. Fundamental Brokers Inc, a major U.S. Brokers' broker, has decided to launch yen bond broking on its display system in New York as early as April. CBOT's start of an evening session, planned for the end of April, will also multiply yen bond futures trading, a Nomura Securities Co Ltd bond manager said. But there are still obstacles to trading on the London market. ""Problems concerning cash bond delivery and clearing are major obstacles for an early launching at LIFFE,"" said Koki Chiyojima, deputy general manager of Nikko Securities Co Ltd's bond administration division. Nikko Securities Co Ltd, one of the big four Japanese securities houses, is responsible for corresponding with LIFFE on these matters. Japan's Finance Ministry will start issuing bonds with coupon payment of either March and September, or June and December from April 1, matching futures delivery months. The ministry now pays coupons in January, June, July and December. When delivery months and coupon payments do not match, a 20 pct withholding tax is imposed on interest earned by non-resident bond holders, a deterrent to LIFFE, securities managers said. LIFFE is likely to wait until the outstanding amount of bonds with matching months increases to over several billion yen, bond managers said. These bonds will be used for deliveries, as they are expected to be the cheapest deliverable issues due to low interest rates, they said. Market participants here expect a clearing organisation to be set up by the time they have substantial deliverable cash issues, making overseas listings probable in the latter half of 1987."
u.k. money market offered early assistance,money-fx interest,"The Bank of England said it had invited an early round of bill offers from the discount houses after forecasting a shortage in the system of around 1.1 billion stg. Money market dealers speculated that the central bank could be taking the opportunity to signal a reduction in U.K. Base lending rates by cutting the rates at which it intervenes in the discount market. Most operators are expecting a base rate cut today, possibly of one point, following yesterday's budget in which the U.K. Public sector borrowing target for 1987/88 was slashed by three billion stg. Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain some 1.11 billion stg while a rise in note circulation and bankers' balances below target will take out around 120 mln stg and 20 mln stg respectively. Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions will add some 140 mln stg to the system today."
"taiwan buys 462,000 tonnes of u.s. maize",grain corn,"The joint committee of Taiwan's maize importers awarded contracts to five U.S. Companies to supply a total of 462,000 tonnes of maize for delivery between May 10 and October 10, a committee spokesman said.

"lawson happy with sterling, backs latest rate cut",money-fx interest,"Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said he was content with the current level of sterling and welcomed today's announcement of a further half point cut in British bank base lending rates to 10 pct. However, he said he wanted to see a gradual approach to declines in domestic U.K. Interest rates, although optimism in financial markets might push for big moves quickly. He told a briefing of economic journalists that ""I don't think we should rush anything."" Lawson stressed the themes of ""gradualism and steadiness"" as economic policy. Lawson acknowledged that today's fall in interest rates were in response to his budget for fiscal 1987/88, unveiled yesterday to Parliament and which set a lower target for the key Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) of 1.0 pct of GDP. Lawson said the two recent cuts in base rates, both made this month in the form of half percentage point declines, were ""perfectly consistent"" with monetary conditions now in Britain. He supported that by saying the narrow M0 money supply aggregate was ""safely inside"" its flucuation band of two to six pct set for both 1986/87 and 1987/88. In his budget, Lawson set no explicit target range for the broader sterling M3. Turning to the question of Britain eventually joining the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System (EMS), Lawson repeated that ""it is most unlikely we will enter before the next election."" He said Britain was keeping the subject of full EMS membership under constant review. But he would not indicate what the chief considerations for this were for the government. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher late last year said a decision on whether or not to join depended on the strength of the U.K. Economy. But she later said such a move depended on other EMS countries scrapping residual capital controls. Although Lawson denounced what he said was ""the current wave of election fever"" in Britain, he added: ""It is more likely that there will be an election this year"" than not. He said he supported an early election only because it would clear the air. ""Ideally, we (the government) should have a full term,"" but events could force a premature poll, Lawson said. The government, which has been in power since 1979, must call an election by June 1988. Speculation is rising for either a June or an early autumn election, political sources said. The decision to cut basic tax by only two pence in 1987/88 ""was the right balance, economically and politically,"" he said. Lawson's decision to restrict the fall in the standard rate of tax to two-pence surprised many analysts, who had predicted that with Treasurys coffers full of tax revenue would have allowed the government to reach its goal of 25 pct in one move. But it was being praised today by political analysts as a shrewd move which, while advancing towards that aim, could not be seized upon by opposition parties as overtly trying to bribe the electorate. Lawson told journalists he had been surprised by how much the PSBR had undershot his original assumption of 7.1 billion stg for 1986/87 -- by some three billion stg. Returning to changing levels of interest rates, Lawson stressed that ""they are not an objective (for the government) - they are an instrument of policy."" Consequently the Treasury had no precise target for domestic borrowing levels, he said. But ""there may be interest rate consequences"" from changes in the level of government borrowing, he added. Lawson said he did not think that the U.K.'s relatively high level of real interest rates had hurt investment in Britain. He said conditions created by London's role as a leading financial centre had caused sterling interest rates to be higher in real terms than in other countries. Three factors had caused the higher level in relative interest rates in Britain, Lawson said. First, control of credit in Britain rested on interest rates alone, due to the freedom of its financial markets. He said the second reason was political uncertainty caused by proposed spending plans of the opposition Labour Party. Thirdly, he said ""we do not have as long a track record of low inflation"" as did the U.S., Japan and West Germany. Lawson foresaw London becoming the world's pre-eminent financial centre, because it was more international in character and more favourably placed in time zones than New York or Tokyo."
iraq says it attacks two ships in gulf,ship crude,"Iraq said its warplanes hit two ships off the Iranian coast in attacks last night and early today. The planes ""dealt accurate and effective blows to both maritime targets before they returned safely to base,"" a military spokesman told the Iraqi new agency INA. There was no immediate confirmation of the attacks from Persian Gulf shipping sources. The last confirmed Iraqi attack on shipping was on March 8, when an Iranian tanker was hit by a missile south of Iran's Kharg island oil export terminal. Gulf shipping sources yesterday reported an Iranian warship had set the Cypriot supertanker Pivot on fire with a missile. They said there were no injuries on board and the ship headed for the Gulf Emirate of Fujairah under its own power after the fire was put out. The Pivot was the 18th ship hit this year in the maritime extension of the 6-1/2 year-old Iran-Iraq war."
new zealand economy forecast to improve in 1987/88,interest trade gnp bop cpi,"New Zealand's inflation and interest rates should decline and the balance of payments improve significantly in the fiscal year to the end of March 1988, the Institute of Economic Research (NZIER) said. The independent institute said in its quarterly March issue that it was also revising its fiscal 1987 real gross domestic product (GDP) forecast to a fall of 0.5 pct against the one pct drop forecast in December. Government figures show GDP grew at an annual 1.8 pct in the quarter to September and 3.4 pct in the June quarter. The NZIER said the sharp improvement in the June and September quarters was due mainly to a new tax structure and the introduction of a 10 pct value-added goods and services tax and is not expected to continue in the second half of 1986/87. The government's tight fiscal position is not expected to change, it said. Annual inflation, measured by the consumer price index, is forecast to fall to nine pct by next March from 18.2 pct in calendar 1986, it said. ""Falling inflation is likely to give significant scope for reductions in nominal interest rates; real interest rates are also expected to ease (albeit slightly) as the balance of payments deficit and hence the call on overseas capital, falls away,"" the NZIER said. Short-term interest rates are forecast to remain between 20 and 25 pct until the June quarter, but will decline over the second half of 1987/88 to between 16 and 18 pct. Long-term rates are expected to fall to between 14 and 16 pct. Five year government bond rates are currently 18.40 pct and the key indicator 30-day bank bills 26.53 pct. The local dollar is expected to depreciate steadily in the early part of the coming year and, by next March, reach 57.5 on the Reserve Bank's trade weighted index, which is based on a basket of currencies. The index now stands at around 66.4. ""A marked improvement in the balance of payments is forecast,"" the NZIER said. ""The current account deficit is expected to fall from 7.5 pct of GDP in 1985/86 to 4.5 pct in 1986/87 and 2.5 pct in 1987/88."" The current account deficit is forecast to shrink to 1.32 billion N.Z. Dlrs in 1987/88 from 2.40 billion in 1986/87 and 3.33 billion in 1985/86. The 1987/88 budget deficit is forecast to be 2.8 billion dlrs against an expected 2.9 billion dlrs in 1986/87 and 1.87 billion in 1985/86. This compares with the government's 1986/87 deficit figure of 2.92 billion against an earlier forecast of 2.45 billion. ""Conditions in the coming year are sufficiently subdued to contribute to marked improvements in both the balance of payments and the rate of inflation ...,"" the NZIER said. ""Overall, these are significant gains for the New Zealand economy and, if they continue to be improved upon, bode well for future prospects."""

The Federation of Oils Seeds and Fats Associations, FOSFA, in London said it had previously advised traders to adopt the metric system for coconut oil transactions to bring the commodity into line with other vegetable oils."
bundesbank seen steering steady monetary course,money-fx interest,"The Bundesbank is likely to steer a steady monetary course over the next few weeks and a change in credit policies is not expected at tomorrow's regular central bank council meeting, bank economists and dealers said. ""There is no need for action,"" Hermann Remsperger, chief economist of Berliner Handels- and Frankfurter Bank (BHF) said. Others noted that exchange rates are stable after last month's Group of Six agreement in Paris and central bank money stock growth is still well above the three to six pct target zone, so a change in credit policies could be ruled out. One money market dealer said comments by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl at a private seminar in Duesseldorf two weeks ago hinting at another interest rate cut only indicated the Bundesbank might act if conditions changed. Bank economists said U.S. Pressure on West Germany to further ease credit policies had receded since the Paris pact. But such demands could re-emerge if West Germany failed to stimulate its economy enough to affect the massive U.S. Trade deficit. Remsperger said continued strong money supply growth also precluded a further cut in official interest rates. Central bank money stock was growing at an annualized 7.5 pct in February, unchanged from the 7.5 pct in January. Economists said some of the 18 members of the central bank council were worried about the continued overshoot in the money supply target and were bound to resist any moves to cut rates. But Poehl played down the risk of inflation. Economists said the fact that money stock growth remained stable last month was a success. Some said it was likely to return to within the target range later this year. ""The special factors which boosted money supply growth last year are disappearing,"" one economist said. He said some 75 pct of the money supply increase in 1986 was caused by a sharp rise in the inflow of foreign funds. This trend had been reversed recently and with domestic credit demand likely to remain at steady levels, money stock growth was expected to narrow in the medium-term. These developments were increasing the Bundesbank's scope for a rate cut in the medium-term, economists said. Money market dealers said period rates remained little changed, indicating no change in credit policy was expected. Call money rates declined to 3.75/80 pct from 3.90/95 yesterday, with the market well stocked with liquidity. Dealers said call money was soft because tax payments on behalf of customers had been less than expected so far. But rates were likely to tighten again as soon as the full effect of this month's major tax payment period is felt. Payments for the federal railways bond are also likely to burden the market. The Bundesbank did not inject liquidity via a securities repurchase agreement this week, but countered a tightening in rates on Monday by injecting funds through government-owned banks. Dealers said recent securities repurchase pacts had shown the Bundesbank clearly wanted call money rates stable at 3.80. One dealer said, ""If the central bank wanted lower interest rates, it would first of all drive call money rates down."" Banks remained relatively well stocked with minimum reserve assets. They held 52.9 billion marks in minimum reserves on Monday, averaging 53.7 billion marks over the first 16 days of March. A requirement of around 51 billion is expected."
davy corp unit wins india smelter contract,zinc lead,"Davy McKee Ltd, a subsidiary of U.K. Engineering and contruction company Davy Corp Plc, has been awarded a contract worth around 15 mln stg for the design of a zinc and lead smelter in India, a spokesman for the company said. The contract is being funded by Britain's Overseas Development Administration as part of a total grant of 73.65 mln stg to India's state-owned Hindustan Zinc Ltd. The grant is for the development of a major zinc and lead mine and associated smelting complex in Rajastan, North West India, the agency said. The agency said the project was expected to account for 44 pct of India's total production of zinc. A total 55 mln stg of the grant is allocated for the supply of goods and services from Britain. The grant comes as part of package announced on March 13 for Indian mineral development. The agency is also paying a further 31 mln stg to India's coal sector, for the expansion of its indigenous coal development programme, using British-designed longwall technology."

thai trade deficit widens in february,trade bop,"Thailand's trade deficit widened to an estimated 4.7 billion baht in February from 2.1 billion in January and 2.8 billion a year ago, the Bank of Thailand said. Exports fell to around 18.9 billion baht from 20.4 billion in January compared with 17.4 billion a year ago, the bank said. Imports rose to 23.6 billion baht from 22.5 billion in January. They were 20.2 billion in February 1986. The bank said the trade deficit for the two months widened to an estimated 6.8 billion baht from 5.2 billion a year ago. February's current account showed a 1.2 billion baht deficit compared with 1.7 billion in January and 263 mln a year ago. The current account for the two months posted an estimated 500 mln baht surplus, down from 1.2 billion a year ago. A surplus in the country's balance of payments narrowed to 3.2 billion baht in February from 4.6 billion the previous month but was higher than 1.5 billion a year ago. The bank said the balance of payments surplus for the first two months of 1987 widened to 7.8 billion baht from 4.6 billion from the same period in 1986, while the net capital inflow rose to five billion baht from 3.1 billion."
"u.k. base rates will fall again soon, say analysts",interest money-fx,"Today's modest half-point cut in U.K. Bank base lending rates to 10 pct signals the Bank of England's determination to maintain a cautious monetary stance, but financial markets appear set to force its hand, analysts said. They said a further half-point cut in base rates to 9-1/2 pct was bound to occur within the next week and rates may shed a further half point soon if markets remain buoyant. Earlier, markets were bracing for a one-point cut in rates after yesterday's budget set a sharp three billion stg reduction in 1987 government borrowing targets to four billion stg. Sterling money market rates moved lower again, with the key three-month interbank rate down to 9-5/8 1/2 pct at the start of business from 9-11/16 9/16 yesterday, and sterling rallied to four-year highs against the dollar in very active trading. Government bond prices also surged on the budget, with gains in excess of one point pushing yields on long-term paper below nine pct for the first time in nearly a year. But today's smaller than expected rate cut appeared to have placated markets for now, analysts said. Money market rates recovered up to 1/4 point from earlier lows while both sterling and gilts came off highs as trading ground to a near halt. Analysts said the slowdown was likely to be temporary, and the reappraisal of sterling assets by international investors was set to resume as early as tomorrow, leading to higher gilt prices, exchange rate advances and lower money market rates. ""Today's cut was slightly disappointing,"" said Bill Martin, chief U.K. Economist at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew. ""The Bank of England is taking a very cautious line ... To temper the markets' first rush of blood to the head after the budget."" Analysts said the bank's move today to lend two-week cash to U.K. Discount houses at a lower 10 pct suggested it hoped to maintain the new rates for about that period of time. The analysts agreed success would depend largely on how sterling performs in the near term. Sharp rises in the pound's value could be checked initially through Bank of England intervention but eventually the gains would force the bank to cut interest rates rates again. ""The market seems to have accepted the modest cut for the time being,"" said Midland Bank treasury economist David Simmonds. ""But I am sceptical that the bank will be able to hold up rates for long."" Simmonds said he saw sterling rising another two U.S. Cents this week from around 1.60 dlrs, forcing a rate cut by Friday. Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan Securities, said ""There is another half point to come in the near term, this week or next week at the latest...We see a whole point off base rates in the next two or three weeks."" Analysts stressed that apart from prestige, Britain had very little to gain from a sharp rise in sterling's exchange rate. Martin, of Phillips and Drew, said the dampening effect of a sterling rise on consumer price inflation would not materialise for at least nine months while its hampering impact on manufactured exports would show almost immediately. Analysts said the budget, featuring income tax cuts as well as cautious plans for public finances, had improved the chances of re-election for the Conservative government and probably advanced the election date. One must be held before June, 1988. Combined with overall good prospects for the U.K. Economy, this was likely to fuel a foreign rush on sterling-denominated assets, pushing the pound's value well above unofficial targets. With mark-denominated investments largely out of favour because of low yields and a dull economic outlook, Chase's Marshall said ""Sterling is simply the best game in town, especially after the budget, and demand will remain strong."""

fed expected to add reserves in money market,money-fx interest,"The Federal Reserve is expected to enter the U.S. Government securities market to add temporary reserves indirectly via 1.5 billion dlrs or more of customer repurchase agreements, economists said. They said the below-six pct Federal funds rate suggests the Fed does not have a large reserve adding need. However, some dealers reportedly backed out of the three-day System repurchase agreements set on Monday, leaving the Fed with a somewhat increased need to supply reserves. Federal funds, which averaged 6.05 pct yesterday, opened at 5-15/16 pct and remained there in early trading."
"ec oils tax, canada corn ruling opposed by panel",grain corn veg-oil,"The U.S. Senate Finance Committee approved nonbinding resolutions urging the Reagan administration oppose Canada's ruling on U.S corn imports and a proposed new European Community tax on vegetable oils. The resolutions, approved by voice vote, now will be sent to the Senate floor were they are expected to be approved. The EC oils measure, offered by Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., urges the administration to take strong retaliatory measures if the tax is approved by the EC Council of Ministers. Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., offered the corn amendment which urges the administration to file a complaint with the GATT if the U.S. believes the corn decision by Canada was unjustified. Canada recently imposed a permanent duty of 85 cents per bushel on U.S. corn imports."
u.s. corn market skewed by soviet buying,grain corn ship,"Recent purchases of U.S. corn by the Soviet Union have skewed the domestic cash market by increasing the price difference between the premium price paid at the Gulf export point and interior levels, cash grain dealers said. Many dealers expect the USDA will act soon to reduce the cash price premium at the Gulf versus the interior -- which a dealer in Davenport, Iowa, said was roughly 20 pct wider than normal for this time of year at 25 cents a bushel -- by making it worthwhile for farmers to move grain. By lowering ASCS county posted prices for corn, the USDA could encourage farmers to engage in PIK and roll corn sales, where PIK certificates are used to redeem corn stored under the government price support loan program and then marketed. If the USDA acts soon, as many dealers expect, the movement would break the Gulf corn basis. ""The USDA has been using the Gulf price to determine county posted prices,"" one dealer said. ""It should be taking the average of the Gulf price and the price in Kansas City,"" which would more closely reflect the lower prices in the interior Midwest. ""But we don't know when they might do it,"" an Ohio dealer said, which has created uncertainty in the market. The USDA started the PIK certificate program in an effort to free up surplus grain that otherwise would be forfeited to the government and remain off the market and in storage. Yesterday, USDA issued a report showing that only slightly more than 50 pct of the 3.85 billion dlrs in PIK certificates it has issued to farmers (in lieu of cash payments) had to date been exchanged for grain. With several billion dlrs worth of additional PIK certificates scheduled to be issued in the coming months, the USDA would be well advised to encourage the exchange for grain by adjusting the ASCS prices, cash grain dealers said. A byproduct of the Soviet buying has been a sharp rise in barge freight costs quoted for carrying grain from the Midwest to the export terminals, cash dealers said. Freight from upper areas of the Mississippi have risen nearly 50 pct in the past two weeks to over 150 pct of the original tariff price. The mild winter and early reopening of the mid-Mississippi river this spring have also encouraged the firmer trend in barge freight, dealers noted. The higher transportation costs have served to depress interior corn basis levels, squeezing the margins obtained by the elevators feeding the Gulf export market as well as discouraging farmer marketings, they said. ""The Gulf market overreacted to the Soviet buying reports,"" which indicate the USSR has booked over two and perhaps as much as 4.0 mln tonnes of U.S. corn, one Midwest cash grain trader said. But dealers anticipate that once the rumors subside, freight rates will settle back down because of the overall surplus of barges on the Midwest river system."
german research institute lowers growth forecast,gnp trade,"The DIW economic research institute said West German economic growth in 1987 is unlikely to reach the 1.5 pct rate it had forecast earlier this year. The institute, whose forecasts are more pessimistic than those of the other four leading German institutes, said the economy had passed its peak in the summer of 1986, and its prospects had dimmed significantly since the autumn. The DIW repeated earlier predictions that gross national product (GNP) in the first quarter of 1987 would contract in real, seasonally adjusted terms against the weak final quarter of last year. The DIW said that even if the economy recovers in the remaining three quarters, it was unlikely that demand and production would rise strongly enough to bring GNP growth up to 1.5 pct. Other institutes and economists have recently revised their forecasts for German 1987 growth to around two pct. In a report DIW disputed arguments by other economists that the economy was showing mixed development, with domestic demand healthy but foreign demand weak. DIW said the crucial split was between weak demand for capital goods, and strong demand for buildings and consumer goods, not between foreign and domestic demand. It noted that domestic demand for capital goods had been hit in recent months by the weakness of exports, which had caused West German firms to scale back investment plans. Service industries, unlike manufacturing industry, were continuing to do well because they relied on consumer demand, it said. In a separate report the HWWA economic research institute in Hamburg said West Germany's real trade surplus would fall markedly this year. However, the nominal trade surplus would show little change from 1986's record 112.2 billion marks because of a further improvement in the terms of trade on average in 1987 compared with 1986, it said."

u.s energy secretary proposes oil tax incentives,crude nat-gas,"Energy Secretary John Herrington said he will propose tax incentives to increase domestic oil and natural gas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration for consideration. ""These options boost production, while avoiding the huge costs associated with proposals like an oil import fee,"" Herrington told a House Energy subcommittee hearing. ""It is my intention to submit these proposals to the domestic policy council and the cabinet for consideration and review."" He said proposals, including an increase in the oil depletion allowance and repeal of the windfall profits tax, should be revenue neutral and promote domestic production at the least cost to the economy and the taxpayers. ""The goal of the Administration policies is to increase domestic production. I would like to shoot for one mln barrels a year."" The proposals were based on a DOE study released yesterday warning the United States was threatened by a growing dependence on oil imports. ""We project free world dependence on Persian Gulf oil at 65 pct by 1995,"" Herrington said. He said it was too soon to say what the Administration policy on oil tax incentives would be and indicated there would be opposition to tax changes. ""Of course, to move forward with these kinds of options would require reopening tax issues settled last year (in the tax reform bill) -- an approach which has not, in general, been favored by the administration. I think what we need is to debate this within the Administration,"" he said. He said the proposals might raise gasoline prices. Herrington did not specifically confirm a report in today's Washington Post that he had written to President Reagan urging an increase in the oil depletion allowance. Asked about the report by subcommittee members, Herrington said various proposals were under consideration and would be debated within the Administration to determine which would have the most benefits at the least cost."

energy/drilling industry,crude nat-gas,"The drastic cutbacks in U.S. drilling last year are rapidly deflating the United State's natural gas bubble, which could bring spot shortages in gas supplies next winter and a modest recovery in the oilpatch, industry analysts said. Faltering deliverability of natural gas, a commodity that is difficult and costly to import in large quantities, could more than double the current U.S. rig count to near 2,000 by 1990, some analysts said. The need to lock in future supplies of gas for utilities and big industrial customers may also bring a resurgence of activity in the Gulf of Mexico's offshore waters where some of the nation's largest gas reserves are located. ""We think an upturn in U.S. drilling is imminent,"" said James Crandall, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. ""Many companies appear to be switching from oil to gas drilling because they're betting that the gas market will be back in balance in a year or two."" The prospect of diminishing gas supplies is welcome news for drilling and oilfield service companies that barely survived last year's plunge in oil prices from about 30 dlrs a barrel to less than half that. Today's relatively stable oil prices of about 18 dlrs a barrel are not enough to spur a return to the heady days of 1981 when the U.S. drilling rig count soared to a record high of more than 4,500 and oilfield roustabouts commanded premium wages. The latest weekly Hughes Tool Co <HT> rig count, a barometer of the oil industry's health, showed 761 U.S. rigs active in what is traditionally the slowest time of the year. In 1986, the Hughes rig count began the year at 1,915 but dived to a post-World War II low of 663 in July as world oil prices experienced the sharpest decline in recent times. Ike Kerridge, a Hughes economist, said ""In 1986, the United States replaced only about 40 pct of the gas it used and that replacement rate won't be any better this year."" He added, ""We don't have the options we do with oil. Imports of gas from Canada are limited by pipeline capacity and importing liquefied natural gas on ships will not be feasible in the next 10 years because of the cost."" Only about 6 trillion cubic feet of additional gas reserves were discovered last year while U.S. consumption approached 16 trillion cubic feet, according to industry estimates. George Gaspar, an oil analyst with Robert W. Baird and Co agreed that the need for gas supplies would set the stage for a new cycle of gradual increases in U.S. drilling. ""We anticipate that natural gas pipelines will need to dedicate to their systems new gas reserves for 1989 and 1990 supplies. That means new drilling programs must begin no later than mid-1988,"" Gaspar said. Gasper said he sees a new drilling cycle emerging that could last until 1992 and that he expects the average rig count to peak near 2,000 in December of 1989. Much of the search for new gas reserves is likely to be conducted in the offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico, where federal leases on unexplored areas will revert back to the government unless drilling begins in the next two or three years. Some of the industry's biggest companies, such as Exxon Corp <XON>, Mobil Corp MOB, and Union Texas Petroleum have already indicated plans to increase spending for drilling later this year in the Gulf of Mexico, Crandall said. For example, Conoco Inc, a Dupont <DD> subsidiary, will spend 400 mln dlrs to build the Gulf of Mexico's deepest production platform, which will produce 50 mln cubic feet of gas per day. But T. Boone Pickens, who has acquired huge Texas and Kansas gas reserves for his Mesa Limited Partnership <MLP> in recent months, is not convinced that the drilling industry is on the verge of a recovery. Pickens predicts the U.S. rig count will soon drop below 600 and will not increase significantly until oil prices do. ""The rigs won't go back to work until the price of oil gets above 30 dlrs a barrel,"" said Pickens, 58, adding he did not expect to see the rig count top 2,000 again in his lifetime. Tenneco Inc <TGT>, one of the largest U.S. gas producers, is skeptical that a need for additional gas drilling exists. Tenneco vice president Joe Foster said he did not expect significant increases in drilling for gas until the early 1990s when the U.S. gas reserves life will have declined to about seven years' supply. Current spot market prices of about 1.50 dlrs per thousand cubic feet will need to rise to about three dlrs to spur reserve replacement, he said."
house farm leader sees billion dlr budget cuts,grain wheat,"The 1988 agriculture budget will have to be cut by an additional one to two billion dlrs, the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee said. Implementation of a 0/92 program, a tightening up of the use of commodity certificates, and reconstitution of farms are possibilities that will be studied to reduce farm spending, said Dan Glickman, D-Kans., chairman of the House agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feedgrains. Speaking at the annual meeting of the National Grain and Feed Association, Glickman said he learned this week from the House budget committee that the agriculture committee will have to reduce the fiscal year 1988 farm budget by up to two billion dlrs from the 30 billion dlrs level already approved. Decisions on how to cut the farm budget will have to be made very quickly in order to make any impact on the FY 1988 budget, Glickman added. Glickman also said his committee will not approve USDA's proposal to cut target prices by ten pct per year. ""The administration's target price proposals are dead in the water,"" he said. To cut the budget, Glickman said, ""everthing is on the table,"" except those moves that would reduce farmers' income. Glickman offered a list of possibilities that his committee will study in order to cut farm spending. Implementation of a 0/92 program for 1987 winter wheat and 1988 feedgrains crops has been introduced by Glickman, which he said would result in a 150-200 mln dlr savings for one year. Tightening up on the use of generic (in-kind, or ""pik') certificates will also be another option his committee will study, Glickman said. While not committing himself for or against such action, he said lawmakers have to examine recent government findings which indicate certificates cost more than cash payments. Glickman said rules for the reconstitution of farms and tightening up of the person definition for annual payment limitations is another option and could save 100-200 mln dlrs. He also said increasing acreage set-aside requirements by five pct for wheat and feedgrains at program sign-up was a move that could save about one billion dlrs, but added that he would not be in favor of such a change. Glickman also said that the Export Enhancement Program's, EEP, spending authority of 1.5 billion dlrs is quickly being used up, and Congress will have to decide whether to expand this program while making cuts in other areas. Cuts in the EEP program are unlikely, he said. ""I don't see right now that the EEP will be on the chopping block,"" Glickman said."
u.s. energy industry said in better health,crude nat-gas,"The U.S. oil and gas industry is in better health than it was a year ago, according to testimony given to the Texas Railroad Commission at its annual state of the industry hearing today. The Commission, which regulates the state's oil and gas industry, heard testimony from a number of high-level company executives reflecting a belief that the recent industry downturn had bottomed out. ""The attitude expressed here today so far is a great deal more optimistic (than last year),"" Commissioner James E. (Jim) Nugent told Reuters. ""It reflects their (the executives) belief that they are seeing the bottom of the economic cycle,"" he added, ""and with just a few reasonable breaks this industry can begin to move again."" The energy industry was hard hit by the sharp drop in oil prices, which fell from around 30 dlrs a barrel in late 1985 to as low as 10 dlrs in mid-1986. Prices have since steadied to around 18 dlrs a barrel. At the same time, a number of company executives testified that the nation's domestic exploration and production segment was still hurting and in need of government help. Production costs are considerably higher in the United States than in such areas as the Middle East and as prices fell many domestic producers were forced to shut down their operations. Currently, there are only about 760 oil rigs operating in the United States compared with an average of nearly 2,000 in 1985. Citing a study released yesterday by the Department of Energy, many said the falling production of domestic oil coupled with increasing U.S. demand, was leading to a growing dependency on imports, particularly from the politically volatile Middle East. ""In the U.S., 1986 petroleum production responded to lower prices, increasing about 2.5 pct, or 400,000 barrels per day (bpd),"" said J.S. Simon, General Manager of the Supply Department at Exxon Corp <XON>, the nation's largest oil company. At the same time, Simon said ""U.S. oil production declined by 300,000 bpd, the first decline in several years,"" and ""net petroleum imports were up 25 pct to 5.3 mln bpd."" Noting that while oil prices were expected to remain between 13 and 20 dlrs a barrel, depending on OPEC's ability to control production, Simon said demand is expected to remain at 1986 levels, leading to ""a significant amount of spare worldwide production capacity, in excess of 10 mln bpd."" He said the surplus capacity would lead to continued volatility and called for ""governmental and regulatory policies in support of the domestic petroleum industry."" Citing the costs recently imposed by the federal government through the 1986 tax code changes and ""Superfund"" legislation, Simon called for the repeal of the windfall profits tax, total decontrol of natural gas and improved access to federal lands for oil and gas exploration. Simon did not mention an oil import fee, which many in the industry have called for as a way of building up the nation's domestic operations before imports reach such a level that national security might be compromised. In yesterday's report, the Energy Department said imports could make up 50 pct of U.S. demand by 1995, adding that Persian Gulf producers will provide as much as 65 pct of the free world's total oil consumption by that date. Arguing that ""oil is a political tool in every nation on earth,"" Frank Pitts, chairman of <Pitts Oil Co>, today called for a variable oil import fee, among other measures, ""before the treacherous foothold of the Middle East is irreversible and our national security is compromised."" Royce Wisenbaker, Chairman of Wisenbaker Production Co, agreed, saying that like many federal government programs that were set up with good intentions, it would probably turn into a ""shambles."" Wisenbaker added that he was optimistic for the future. ""For those of us who have managed to hold on, the worst is over,"" he said. Roger Hemminghaus, President of Diamond Shamrock Refining and Marketing Co, said he was ""enthusiastic about the future,"" adding that he expected ""an increase in profitability by midyear."""
ussr corn buying may be 3.5 mln tonnes--amstutz,grain corn,"The Soviet Union's recent corn purchases from the United States could total as much as 3.5 mln tonnes, U.S. Agriculture Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said. ""We are not sure how much (Soviets have bought) but we think it could be as high as 3.5 mln tonnes,"" Amstutz told a House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee. He added that China also will need to import more corn this year than earlier anticipated, but he gave no figures."
ne electric sees higher construction outlays,crude nat-gas earn,"New England Electric System <NES> expects its cash construction spending to reach 205 mln dlrs this year, up from 188 mln dlrs in 1986, the utility said in material distributed at an analysts meeting. It said spending is expected to advance to 215 mln dlrs in 1988 and 220 mln dlrs in 1989. The utility said these totals exclude spending on New England Hydro-Transmission being built to import electricity from Quebec Hydro. New England Electric is the operator of this venture as well as owning 51 pct of the project. The venture expects to spend 65 mln dlr this year, 105 mln dlrs next year and 125 mln dlrs in 1989 to build transmission lines from northern Quebec into New England, the utility said. New England Electric said internally generated funds will cover all of its power plant construction costs this year and 65 pct of the 108 mln dlrs its retail distribution units plan to spend in 1987. The company said it also expects to spend 60 mln dlrs on its oil and gas activities this year, adding internally generated funds are expected to provide 85 pct of this total. New England Electric said it plans to issue 30 mln dlrs worth of pollution control bonds in 1987 and retire additional higher cost preferred stock. Its Granite State Electric unit plans to issue five mln dlrs of long term notes early this year as well. The company said it does not plan to offer common shares this year or in the foreseeable future, but expects to raise about 40 mln dlrs in equity through the sale of stock under its dividend reinvestment plan and employee share plans. President Samuel Huntington told the analysts the construction spending projection is based on the expectation that demand for electricity in the New England electric system will grow about two pct a year for the next 15 years. However, the utility cannot ignore the potential for sharper growth, he said, pointing out that demand was up 5.2 pct in 1986 and 4.7 pct per year in the past four years. He attributed this growth to declining electricity prices and a strong New England economy. Huntington said New England Elecetric has ""all but rejected new coal fired plants"" to supply additional power. He said the most attractive new power supplies are those with short lead times which can be built in modules. Later, vice president Glenn Schleede said the utility is looking at gas-fired, combined cycle generating units to supply most of its new power needs, but has not rejected coal-fired fluidized bed units. He explained that fluidized bed technology is available in modular units, adding that Huntington was referring to the traditional coal-fired plant which burns pulverized coal."
u.s. wheat growers set state dept trade meeting,grain wheat,"The National Association of Wheat Growers, NAWG, board of directors is scheduled to meet Secretary of State George Schultz and Undersecretary of State Allen Wallis to discuss the Department's current role in farm trade policy, the association said. NAWG President Jim Miller said in a statement that the organization wanted to convey to Secretary Schultz the importance that exports hold for U.S. agriculture and the degree to which farmers are dependent upon favorable State Department trade policies to remain profitable. ""Foreign policy decisions of the U.S. State Department have in the past severely hampered our efforts to move our product to overseas markets,"" he said. Miller noted Secretary Schultz is scheduled to meet next month with representatives of the Soviet Union, and the NAWG ""wanted to be certain the secretary was aware of our concerns regarding the reopening of wheat trade with the Soviet Union."" The annual spring NAWG board of directors meeting is held in Washington to allow grower-leaders from around the country to meet with their state congressional delegations and members of the executive branch. The purpose is to discuss the current situation for producing and marketing wheat and help set the legislative and regulatory agenda for the coming year, the NAWG statement said."

mexican hydrocarbon reserves fall slightly in 1986,crude nat-gas,"mexico's proven reserves of liquid hydrocarbons at end-1986 were 70 billion barrels, slightly down from 70.9 billion a year ago and 71.75 billion in 1984, the state oil company petroleos mexicanos (pemex) announced. Reserves were just 5.77 billion barrels in 1974, rose sharply to 40.19 billion in 1978 and flattened out at 72 billion in both 1981 and 1982. In its annual report, pemex said average crude output in 1986 was 2.43 mln barrels per day, 202,000 bpd down on 1985. Average exports were 1.29 mln bpd, down from 1.44 mln bpd. The company did not say what percentage of hydrocarbons was crude oil, but has previouly said it was about 48 pct. Natural gas output in 1986 was 3.43 billion cubic feet per day, down from 3.6 billion in 1985. Due mainly to the fall in oil prices to around 12 dlrs from 25 dlrs in the year, 58 wells, both exploratory and production, were suspended, 38 of them in less productive areas than the offshore campeche fields which accounted for 64 pct of production."
division seen on how to help u.s. oil industry,crude nat-gas,"The U.S. Congress and the oil industry are deeply divided on ways the government should assist the industry, hurt by the sharp fall in oil prices, and the subsequent growth in oil imports, industry analysts said. ""The industry is deeply divided between those who support an oil tariff and those who believe tax incentives are better,"" said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, which recently completed a survey of the U.S. Congress on energy issues. Yergin said he saw mounting support within Congress for tax incentives rather than an oil tariff or import fee. Today U.S. Energy Secretary John Herington said he will propose tax incentives to increase edomestic oil and natural gas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration for consideration. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the proposal would be reviewed. Herrington said, ""I would like to shoot for one mln barrels a day (addition) to U.S. production."" U.S. oil output was off to 8.4 mln bpd in the week of March 13, down six pct from last year, the American Petroleum Institute said. Oil industry analysts have forecast oil prices to average about 18 dlrs a barrel for the year and many believe that a move above that level will be unlikey for the near term. Paul Mlotok, oil analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc said that ""even with the rise in prices for the last week or two we've only altered our average price scenerio to about 17.50 dlrs for the year."" Analysts said that at that price renewed drilling and exploration to reverse the decline in U.S. crude oil output will not take place as the companies are waiting for stable prices over 20 dlrs to renew exploration. John Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation Inc in New york in recent testimony to Congress said ""The continuing decline in U.S. oil production is virtually inevitable under any realistic price scenario. But the future rate of decline is very much a function of world oil prices and U.S. government policy."" Lichtbalu said that tax breaks could be used to raise oil production but would only work over time. ""Lowering the producing industry's tax burden would probably be a slower stimulant (to output) than a price increase but would not raise energy costs."" Lichtblau said. But the small independent oil companies who do much of the drilling in the U.S. are looking for the more immediate relief which could be brought on by an oil import fee. Ronald Tappmeyer, president of the International Association of Drilling Contractors, said, ""The members of our trade asssociation are convinced that only a variable oil import fee that sets a minimum price trigger can protect our nation."" The association represents some 1,300 drilling and oil service companies. The CERA survey of Congress shows that the oil import fee will face a stiff uphill battle. Yergin said that the poll which was conducted in January by a former Congressman, Orval Hansen, showed support for the oil import fee from 22 pct of the Congressmen surveyed largely as a means of protecting the domestic petroleum industry. At the same time 48 pct of the Congressmen surveyed opposed the fee with the respondents saying the tariff would hurt consumers and some regional interests. But 80 pct of the sample said support for a fee could grow if production continued to fall and imports to rise. Yergin said that imports above 50 pct of U.S. requirements ""is a critical, symbolic level. If they (imports) move above that level, a fee may not be legislated but there will certainly be pressure for some form of action."" But Lichtblau, in a telephone interview, said, ""a 50 pct rate of import dependency is not likely to happen before 1990. In 1986 U.S. oil imports rose to 33 pct of u.s. energy requirements and shopuld be about 34 pct in 1987, he added."
shultz says u.s. products must be competitive,grain wheat,"Asked what the U.S. State Department's policy is on offering subsidized wheat to Moscow, Secretary of State George Shultz told a group of farm leaders that U.S. products must be competitive in the world market. ""If we are going to sell our products, whatever they may be, wheat or anything else, then we have to meet the market,"" Shultz told the board of directors for the National Association of Wheat Growers. ""We have to be competitive. It's ridiculous to say that somebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same thing at a lower price somewhere else. They just aren't,"" he said. ""That is our approach in the negotiations with the Soviets, and it must be our approach as we look at the American farm program and try to figure out what we should do to make it better,"" Shultz told the Wheat Growers. Schultz said that while he does not favor a situation that would allow the Soviet housewife to buy food cheaper than the American housewife, he realizes the importance of American agricultural products being competitively priced. Speculation has been in the market for some time that the United States is considering offering wheat to the Soviet Union at subsidized prices. Soviet officials have said they would buy U.S. wheat if it were competitively priced. Agriculture Department officials have declined to take any official position on the issue."
"argentine maize, soybean forecasts fall",grain corn sorghum sunseed oilseed soybean,"Argentine grain growers reduced their estimates for maize and soybean production in the current harvest in the week to yesterday, trade sources said. Soybean production for 1986/87 is now estimated to reach between 7.7 and eight mln tonnes, versus 7.8 to 8.2 mln tonnes estimated a week ago and eight to 8.4 mln tonnes estimated in mid-February. But even the lowest of those estimates would be 8.5 to 12.7 pct greater than last year's total of 7.1 mln tonnes, according to official figures, and would be a new record. The total area planted with soybeans for this harvest was a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares and increased 10.8 to 13.8 pct compared to the 3.3 mln hectares planted last year. The change in yield estimates is due to very high temperatures and inadequate rainfall since early in the year in the soybean-producing belt of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires province. The heat and lack of rain combined to leave many soybean pods empty, especially in Cordoba. Intense rains in recent weeks did not affect crops, since rainfall was slight in most main soybean-producing areas. Rains in the week to yesterday were isolated and weak in Buenos Aires province, totalling between one and 10 mm. There was no recorded rain in other grain-producing provinces. With clear skies and seasonable temperatures, fields were able to dry in areas that had received heavy rains in recent weeks, allowing growers to accelerate the pace of maize, sunflower and sorghum harvesting. Crops were considered in generally good condition, though it is still too early to judge whether the intense rains of recent weeks caused any long-term damage. The maize harvest advanced to between 20 and 22 pct of the total area planted, compared to 13 to 15 pct a week ago. Total area planted with maize for this harvest stood at 3.58 to 3.78 mln hectares, down two to seven pct from the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the previous harvest. Total production for the current maize harvest is expected to reach between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes, versus 10 to 10.2 mln tonnes estimated a week ago. The new figure is 21.1 to 22.7 pct lower than the 12.8 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest, according to official figures. The sunflower harvest advanced to between 20 and 23 pct of total planted area, versus 15 to 18 pct a week ago. Total area planted with sunflower for this harvest was two to 2.2 mln hectares, or 29.9 to 36.3 pct lower than the record 3.14 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest. The current harvest's volume was again expected to be between 2.3 and 2.6 mln tonnes, or 34.1 to 41.5 pct lower than last harvest's record 4.1 mln tonnes. Yields varied widely from area to area, and growers feared that heavy rains in recent weeks may have taken their toll on crops and, consequently, on total production volume. The sorghum harvest reached between nine and 11 pct of total planted area, compared to four to six pct a week ago. Total area planted with sorghum stood at between 1.2 and 1.3 mln hectares, or 10.3 to 15.2 pct lower than the 1.4 mln hectares planted in the previous harvest. Estimates for total sorghum production this harvest remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes again this week, or 16.7 to 22 pct lower than last harvest's total volume of 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes."

In its weekly petroleum status report, the Energy Department agency said distillate demand was up 2.9 pct in the period to 3.43 mln bpd from 3.33 mln a year earlier. Gasoline demand averaged 6.93 mln bpd, up 4.0 pct from 6.67 mln last year, while residual fuel demand was 1.31 mln bpd, off 7.9 pct from 1.42 mln, the EIA said. Domestic crude oil production was estimated at 8.36 mln bpd, down 8.1 pct from 9.10 mln a year ago, and gross daily crude imports (excluding those for the SPR) averaged 3.70 mln bpd, up 24.8 pct from 2.96 mln, the EIA said. Refinery crude runs in the four weeks were 11.92 mln bpd, up 1.0 pct from 11.80 mln a year earlier, it said. Year-to-date figures will not become available until March 26 when EIA's Petroleum Supply Monthly data for January 1987 becomes available, the agency said."

amstutz sees more bullish wheat outlook in 1987,grain wheat,"U.S. Agriculture Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz indicated the world wheat supply/demand situation has become more bullish recently because of developments in the world market and increased consumption. Speaking to a House Agriculture Appropriations subcommittee, Amstutz cited three factors which have improved the wheat outlook. He said world consumption of wheat is increasing by about 20 mln tonnes this year, primarily for feed use. There are also reports from Australia, Canada and Argentina that plantings have been reduced, he said. Furthermore, he cited reports of greater than normal winterkill in the Soviet Union. ""It seems reasonable to expect production and consumption to be in far better balance than a year ago,"" Amstutz said."

As a result, he said U.S.-produced soybeans ""have a price problem"" in competing with other soybean producing countries. Amstutz called the situation a ""dilemma"" for the USDA, and said ""we have spent hours in ASCS (Agriculture Stabilization and Conservation Service) looking at this."" He did not say what may be done to rectify the situation."

former n.z. premier calls for cheaper currency,money-fx nzdlr,"Former Prime Minister Robert Muldoon, an outspoken advocate of a managed float for the N.Z. Dollar, said the currency is at least 10 pct overvalued. Muldoon said in a speech last night the exchange rate should be around 48 U.S. Cents instead of the current 57 cents. ""A reasonable value for the New Zealand dollar would be between 10 and 15 pct less and nearer 15 than 10. Perhaps around about 48 cents,"" he said. The Labour Party government removed exchange controls and floated the dollar two years ago when it was worth 44 cents. Muldoon has no rank in the opposition National Party, and party leaders, with an eye to general elections to be held by September, have rejected his calls for a managed float. He said the dollar was high because of ""grossly excessive"" interest rates for government stock. ""I know of no other country which is implementing such a free floating policy,"" he added. ""There is widespread agreement internationally that we have no alternative to floating currencies in the short to medium term. But we need more effective methods of managing them so as to limit the volatility which has caused so much concern and damage."""

indonesia sees limited choices on economy,trade bop rubber veg-oil palm-oil,"Indonesia cannot spend its way out of recession and has very limited economic options due to lower world oil prices, Central Bank governor Arifin Siregar was quoted as saying by the official Antara news agency. ""If Indonesia spurs its economic growth too much, such as through expansionary monetary and budgetary policies, it might create negative effects not only on price increases, but also on the balance of payments,"" he told bankers and businessmen in the North Sumatran city of Medan. Antara quoted him as saying Indonesia is relying on its export drive to help narrow its trade deficit. Antara reported that Siregar said the government wanted to help boost exports from the rubber and palm oil industries, which are centered in Sumatra. ""I see Sumatra has great potential, as in the plantation sector in which family units are employed in great number,"" he said, according to the agency. Indonesia relied on oil and gas exports for 70 pct of its export revenue until last year's fall in crude prices. It has projected its current account deficit will widen to over four billion dlrs in the current financial year ending March 31 from 1.8 billion in 1985/86."
australian exports helping to boost gdp,trade bop gnp,"The strong contribution of exports to the growth in Australia's gross domestic product (GDP) in the fourth quarter of 1986 was a significant and welcome feature of the data, private economists polled by Reuters said. Real GDP rose 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986, after rising 0.2 pct in the third quarter and falling 1.1 pct a year earlier. Equally significant was the decline in both private and government spending, they said. Exports of goods and services rose 13 pct in the fourth quarter, while imports rose only 2.9 pct, Statistics Bureau figures show. Consumer spending declined 0.6 pct and government spending by 0.2. Bob Edgar of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd said the government's aim of reducing the current account deficit by boosting exports and lowering consumption to cut imports appeared to be working. However, he cautioned that care must be taken to keep growth restrained because if it accelerated too fast imports would increase and worsen the balance of payments. Andre Morony of Bankers Trust Australia Ltd added the result was positive because growth was export-driven. But he said the GDP rise came as no surprise given the growth in exports disclosed in other statistics. The economists' comments were echoed by Treasurer Paul Keating in a statement issued in Canberra. Keating said the figures showed encouraging trends for a reduction in the current account deficit, notably the decline in domestic demand and the strong increase in exports. A further 3.5 pct fall in the terms of trade in the quarter underscored the need to continue restraint in wages, prices and public sector spending and borrowing to improve Australia's competitiveness, he said. ""It is clear that through the continued application of that strategy Australia will make the necessary adjustments in its external accounts and return to a more sustainable growth pattern,"" he added."

"ec farm lobbies back oils and fats ""tax"" plan",veg-oil soy-oil,"The European Community (EC) farmers' and farm cooperatives lobbies, Copa and Cogeca, have backed the EC Commission plan for an oils and fats price stabilisation mechanism, claiming it would not harm consumers. In a letter to Belgian Foreign Minister Leo Tindemans, current president of the EC Council of Ministers, they said the mechanism, often referred to as a tax, would in fact subsidise oils and fats prices in the EC under some circumstances. This would have been the case in May 1984, when soya oil prices cif Rotterdam stood at 914 dlrs a tonne, they noted. If such price stabilisation is not implemented, EC farmers should not be the ones to suffer through their prices and incomes from the financial consequences, the letter, made available to journalists, said. Under the Commission proposal the mechanism would initially result in a tax of 330 Ecus a tonne on both imported and EC produced oils and marine fats. The mechanism would provide for this tax to be reduced, and possibly to become a subsidy, as world soya oil prices rose from present levels."
"u.s. credit market outlook - spending, m-1",money-fx income money-supply,"Brisk increases in personal income and consumption are to appear in February data released today, but the bond market's recent sluggishness suggests there will be no major price reaction unless the rises are much larger than expected, economists said. Personal income is forecast to rise by 0.6 to 0.8 pct, compared with no change in January, while consumption expenditures are projected to increase 1.4 to 1.6 pct, reversing most of the two pct drop recorded in January. M-1 money supply data for the March 9 week will also be released. An increase of some 2.3 billion dlrs is expected. Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co Inc expects a one pct rise in income, led by a strong gain in wage and salary disbursements in February. Nonfarm payrolls expanded by 337,000 jobs in February, the average workweek lengthened by 0.6 pct and hourly wages rose by four cts, he noted in a report. Vigorous spending on durable goods last month, especially cars, foreshadow a rise of at least 1.5 pct in consumption, he added. The prospect of bearish data did not trouble the bond market much yesterday, with the 30-year Treasury bond slipping just 7/32 to 99-28/32 for a yield of 7.51 pct. Analysts said the market is still trapped in a narrow range, desperately seeking direction. ""Seasonally adjusted, it's already December in the bond market,"" quipped Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc. Paul Boltz of T. Rowe Price Associates Inc said the steadiness of long bond yields around 7.5 pct, despite some signs of a stronger economy, probably reflects expectations that inflation will remain subdued. But he warned that this assumption might not be justified. ""It took the bond market a long while to see that inflation was not returning to double digits, and now that it has learned that lesson, it may be a little slow to see that a four to five pct inflation is a real possibility ahead,"" Boltz said in a report. After trading late yesterday at 5-15/16 pct, Fed funds were indicated by brokers to open comfortably at 5-15/16, six pct."
u.s. delegation hopes for veg oils tax defeat,veg-oil oilseed soybean,"American soybean producers and processors are hoping the proposed EC tax on vegetable oils and fats will not be imposed, but say the U.S. Is prepared to retaliate if it is introduced. Wayne Bennett, the American Soybean Association's first vice president, told a news conference the U.S. Administration would not hesitate to retaliate, but both producers and processors were trying to solve the issue through negotiation. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng said in a letter to EC officials that U.S. Retaliatory measures would cover more than agricultural products if the tax was imposed, Bennett said. The ASA and National Soybean Processors Association (NSPA) delegations will meet top West German government officials today and tomorrow to lobby for support. Bennett said West Germany, Britain, the Netherlands, Denmark and Portugal oppose the tax, but Italy and Belgium seem to have taken a hardline view on the issue. ""Europeans in favour of the tax say it would be to their advantage economically, but that is not correct because we would hit back,"" NSPA chairman Jack Reed said. This step would be very expensive for all and no one would emerge as a winner if the tax were introduced, he said. Reed pointed out the U.S. Administration and the soybean industry view the EC proposal as violating the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The proposed tax also violates the zero duty bindings agreed between the EC and U.S. In 1962, he said. Under the zero duty bindings pact U.S. Soybeans and products can be exported to the Community duty-free."
s.africa's financial rand seen headed higher,money-fx rand,"The financial rand, widely viewed as a direct reflection of foreign investor confidence in South Africa, appears headed above 30 U.S. Cents, dealers and bank economists said. The currency has risen about 25 pct in the past three months to its current rate of 29.50 cents, due partly to signs of a possible power shift with the appearance of a number of independent candidates in the whites-only election on May 6, they added. It has risen about two cents this week alone. ""Another factor is that banks in London, where the main market is based, are going long in the currency because of a general feeling that it will rise in the future,"" one economist said. Dealers described 30 cents as a psychological barrier that was expected to be broken soon after a brief consolidation phase from recent gains. After reaching 30 cents, ""There is a chance of appreciation to 32 cents in the next several weeks,"" one dealer said. There was a widespread feeling that both the commercial rand, holding stable at 48 cents, and the financial rand were staying firm, banking sources said. A Barclays National Bank executive who asked not to be identified said: ""The rise of the independents appears to be indicative of a potential shift of power in the National Party and has created a favourable sentiment overseas."" One dealer said growing business and investor interest from West Germany and Switzerland were behind the financial rand's rise. Economists said foreigners also were being attracted by South Africa's long-term government bonds and ""semi-gilts"" or securities in partly government-owned firms, many with yields as high as 30 pct. They could be purchased with financial rands with interest paid in commercial rands. ""This has had a definite influence on the financial form of the rand,"" a dealer said, adding that at present demand is slightly in excess of supply. The financial rand was reintroduced in September 1985 to help end capital flight from South Africa during a period of severe political unrest in the country."
oecd farm subsidies study results detailed,grain wheat corn,"The results of a controversial study of farm subsidies conducted by the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, show Japan has the highest agriculture subsidies in the world, and that dairy farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from subsidies. Results of the study, which has not been released by OECD because of objections from some countries, were provided to Reuters by officials of several countries on condition they not be identified. The OECD study calculates the level of farm subsidies for the years 1979-81 using a new measure called the producer subsidy equivalent, PSE. The study shows that on dairy products Japan's PSE, or the amount of aid to farmers expressed as a percentage, averaged 83.3 pct over 1979-81, with the European Community at 68.8 pct and the United States 48.2 pct. For wheat Japan's PSE averaged 95.8 pct, the EC 28.1 and the U.S. 17.2. Japan's rice PSE was 68.8 pct compared to the EC 13.6 and the U.S. 5.4 pct, the OECD calculations show. In coarse grains, Japan's subsidies reached 107.1 pct compared with 27.9 pct for the EC and 13.1 pct for the U.S. Japan's beef subsidy was 54.9 pct versus 52.7 pct for the EC and 9.5 pct for the U.S., OECD concluded. For sugar, Japan's PSE was 48.4 pct versus 27.9 pct in the EC and 13.1 pct for the U.S., the study shows. The OECD calculated farm subsidies for other industrial countries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand but in most cases the results were much lower than for the U.S., EC and Japan, the sources said. Subsidies in Argentina and Brazil, two major developing country producers of commodities, were not included in the OECD work. Officials said they hope to persuade reluctant countries to release the study soon, perhaps coinciding with the OECD ministerial meeting in Paris during May. Some officials hope the OECD results will be used as a basis for negotiations during the Uruguay round of global trade talks now underway in Geneva. British Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling during a visit to Washington this week endorsed the OECD work as a starting point for the Uruguay round negotiations on agriculture. He said the PSE calculations provide a tool to negotiate down domestic farm support levels, which are a major cause of the present crisis in world agriculture. However, the OECD study results are controversial because they highlight the levels of assistance to farmers, officials familiar with the study said. The U.S. Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service recently published a study of farm subsidies in an attempt to verify the OECD results and update them to 1982-84. In some cases the results were substantially different than the OECD's, in part because farm policies in both the U.S. and elsewhere had changed markedly by 1982-84 from the OECD base period of 1979-81, U.S. officials said. For example, the USDA study found the United States subsidies to corn producers were higher in 1982-84, at 25 to 49 pct, than in the EC, at zero to nine pct. French Maize Producers Association president Marcel Cazale, citing the result of the USDA calculation for corn, told reporters last week that the United States subsidizes its farmers more than the EC. However, the sources said EC corn subsidies are probably higher than the U.S. now because of increases since 1984. Officials of several countries have been asked to contribute data to OECD so that the study can be updated to 1985 subsidy levels, a much more relevant measure of the current world farm situation. The updated calculations, which may take several months to complete, are expected to show substantial increases in U.S. subsidy levels for sugar because the U.S. imposed restrictive import quotas in 1982 as aid to the domestic industry. U.S. subsidy levels also are increased by the 1985 farm bill, which sharply boosted government deficiency payments to grain farmers and applied a marketing loan for rice, officials added."

soviet timechartering boosts grain freight rates,grain ship,"Current interest by Soviet charterers in taking Panamax vessels on timecharter, mainly from the U.S. To carry grain, is seen as the chief factor behind the recent surge in values on the Baltic International Freight Futures Exchange (BIFFEX), dealers said. Futures soared through the 1,000 points barrier today for the first time in the spot position since the market opened in May 1985. However, the market tends to be nervous, with values some 100 points above the Baltic Freight Index, which is calculated on spot physical rates. No specific figure has been put for Soviet bookings but they have been sufficient to drain Panamax tonnage (about 50,000 to 65,000 tonnes dw) from the U.S. Gulf which would normally operate on the trip to Japan, dealers said. ""It appears that the Chernobyl disaster had a worse effect on its (the Soviet) grain harvest than reported,"" one said. Freight rates on the Gulf/Japan grain route have subsequently been the main beneficiary of current chartering conditions, with very few, if any, Panamax sized ships left for the remainder of this month in the Gulf. Rates have risen steadily for vessels loading next month. Dealers said there is even talk that owners are considering taking older vessels out of lay-up to meet current demand. Sentiment has also been aided by suggestions that Chinese operators may be in the market for similar timecharter business later in the year, they said. They anticipate this would appear around June and it has prompted keen demand in the July BIFFEX contract, despite it normally being a slack time in the shipping year. Market sentiment has fluctuated in recent weeks. Rates turned down as an earlier rise in bunker prices, which had supported the market at the start of the year, faltered but then recovered on the reported Soviet interest."
u.s. energy secretary rules out gasoline tax,gas crude,"Energy Secretary John Herrington said he would rule out a tax on gasoline as one option to help avert what his departmet has called the threat of increased reliance on foreign oil in the coming years. He said at a news conference that any recommendation he would make would have to increase domestic production, not cause widespread economic hardship and have a minimal cost to the U.S. taxpayer. On the grounds of increasing production, he said, ""I would rule out a gasoline tax."" Herrington also repeated he would rule out an oil import fee because of the widespread dislocation it would cause -- the loss of about 400,000 jobs nationwide due to higher oil prices and a drop in the gross national product by about 32 billion dlrs. He said an increased depletion allowance, to 27.5 pct, on new and enhanced production of oil and natural gas would be a cheap way to spur domestic production. He estimated this cost at about 200 mln dlrs a year. Herrington proposed the increased depletion allowance to the White House Tuesday but the White House reaction was cool. The White House said it would study the proposal, but was generally oppposed to altering the national tax code, just passed last year. Herrington, asked his reaction to the White House reaction, said, ""If I were the White House, I would be cool, too."""

britoil sees lower u.k. exploration expenditure,crude earn nat-gas,"Britoil Plc's <BTOL.L> exploration expenditure for the U.K. In 1987 was likely to be only about a third of the level in 1986, though overseas expenditure would remain approximately the same, Chief executive David Walker said. He told reporters following the release of the company's 1986 figures that project expenditure would also remain at 1986 levels. U.K. Project expenditure in 1986 rose to 208 mln stg from 184 mln while exploration expenditure dropped to 87 mln from 156 mln. Overseas exploration fell to 28 mln from 58 mln in 1985. Earlier, Britoil posted a drop in pretax profit for 1986 to 134 mln stg from 759 mln in 1985, before an extraordinary charge of 50 mln stg on the company's U.S. Assets. The results were slightly better than analysts forecast and the share firmed to 231p from 222p at last night's close. Chairman Sir Philip Shelbourne said the collapse in the oil price in 1986 had made the period extremely difficult but the company had come through remarkably well. Provided the recovery in oil prices was maintained, the conditions would be right for a substantially improved performance this year. He added that the firmness of oil prices in March, when they were normally weaker, made him ""a bit encouraged"" about the prospects for future levels. Walker added that Britoil would feel confident if the price stayed within a band of 15 dlrs to 20 dlrs a barrel. Britoil had received some 100 responses to its announcement of a desire to sell the assets and was asking for bids by the latter part of April. End-year reserves rose to 603 mln barrels of oil compared with 503 mln previously. However, Walker noted that this included a revised definition of reserves. If 1985 figures were restated along the same lines, the reserve figure would show a drop from 720 mln barrels previously. Gas reserves also eased to 3,568 billion cubic feet from a restated 3,660 b"

"u.k. money data may ease rate cut, analysts say",money-supply money-fx interest,"Slower than expected growth in Britain's narrow M0 money supply measure in February will help spur a further cut in U.K. Interest rates if a surge in sterling's value requires such a move, economic analysts said. M0, the only targeted money supply measure left after Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson scrapped the official target for the broad sterling M3 measure in his 1987 budget speech on Tuesday, fell an adjusted 3/4 to one pct in February. On an annual basis, this put M0 growth at four to 4-1/2 pct, in the middle of the 1987 target of two to six pct. ""The M0 data are much better than we expected,"" said Robert Thomas, economist at Greenwell Montagu Securities. He and other analysts said while the better than expected M0 figures alone would not be sufficient to trigger a new interest rate cut, they removed an obstacle to such a move. Thomas noted the rise in M0 had been kept in check despite buoyant retail sales in February, advancing an adjusted 2.2 pct after a fall of the same size in January. Analysts said the M0 measure, reflecting variations in consumer demand rather than real inflation prospects, was not an adequate indicator to determine interest rates. ""The authorities still seem to want to pretend that M0 is important ... In practice, it is likely to be the exchange rate and the election which call the tune,"" Lloyds Merchant bank chief economist Roger Bootle wrote in a budget comment. Richard Jeffrey, economist at stockbrokers Hoare Govett, said in a comment: ""It is unlikely that (Lawson) will respond to signals from M0 alone ... Reinforcement from exchange rate trends is necessary before action is taken."" ""With the Chancellor making clear that policy manoeuvres are made in response to signals from this narrow money variable, the City has been forced to take it seriously,"" he added. Noting this point, Thomas said market fears at the end of last year of an M0 overshoot had now disappeared. This removed a potential obstacle to a further cut in U.K. Base lending rates if foreign demand for sterling pushed up the pound above unofficial targets, analysts said. Such targets are believed to have been secretly agreed between finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada at their Paris meeting last month, they added. U.K. Base rates have been cut twice by half a point since the Paris agreement, once on March 11, and again yesterday when foreign demand for sterling surged in reaction to a sharp cut in 1987 government borrowing targets contained in the budget. They stand at 10 pct now, and foreign exchange dealers and analysts expect them to shed another half-point in the coming week. Analysts shrugged off as largely irrelevant a higher than expected increase in February sterling M3, which pushed the annual growth rate to almost 19 pct, well above the previous target of 11 to 15 pct. Thomas said the February figures seemed to indicate the improvement in sterling M3 growth witnessed over the past few months had been reversed, but firm conclusions could only be drawn after revised data are released on March 31. Some analysts said foreign investors had long ceased to watch the sterling M3 target, and Lawson's move to scrap it altogether earlier this week removed whatever was left of its credibility as a key factor in monetary policy."
u.s. grain trade calls shultz remark significant,grain wheat,"A statement yesterday by Secretary of State George Shultz after he met with wheat growers that U.S. agricultural products must be competitively priced was significant in that he recognized the importance of the Soviet market and the need for U.S. prices to be at world market levels, U.S. grain trade industry officials said. They said that Shultz's comments, while not explicitly endorsing subsidized wheat sales to the USSR, were noteworthy because they were not negative towards such action. In response to a query on what the State Department's position is on selling subsidized wheat to Moscow, Shultz told the leaders of the National Association of Wheat Growers that prices must be competitive if the U.S. is going to trade. The Soviet Union, the world's largest grain importer, has bought no U.S. wheat for more than a year, complaining the price was far above world market levels. A U.S. offer last fall to sell the Soviets lower-priced wheat through the export enhancement program, EEP, was also rebuffed due to the price. Shultz was said to be adamantly against the U.S. wheat offer last year and has been reported to be one of the major obstacles in making another subsidy overture to the Soviet Union, grain industry sources said. Intense speculation the U.S. might make a fresh EEP wheat offer to the Soviets has boosted grain prices significantly in recent trading sessions. Kansas City hard wheat futures rose another 2-1/4 cents by midday at 2.88-1/4 dlrs per bushel, while CBT March wheat was up 1-1/2 cents at 2.92-1/2 dlrs. ""I'm not sure this is an about-face, but it's clearly a recognition that unless we're competitive, we won't sell to the Soviet Union,"" said a lobbyst for a major commodity group. ""We have to be competitive. It's ridiculous to say that somebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same thing at a lower price somewhere else,"" Shultz told the farm leaders. ""That is our approach in negotiations with the Soviets,"" he said. If those comments do signal that the State Department is no longer opposed to the U.S. selling wheat to the USSR under EEP, it certainly improves the chances for an EEP wheat offer to Moscow, an industry lobbyst said. National Wheat Grower's officials were taking a cautious attitude towards the secretary's comments. ""His comments were not discouraging, but they didn't in our judgment promise any immediate action on EEP,"" an official with the wheat group said. The Wheat Growers official noted, however, that ""there is significance in that fact that we haven't seen any significant negative commentary on the idea of EEP wheat to the Soviets."" In a meeting with exporters this week, Secretary of Agriculture Richard Lyng refused to comment on their request that the administration offer subsidized wheat to Moscow, the officials said. An aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz, who is reported to be strongly opposed to EEP wheat to the Soviets, said that the Shultz comments ""are consistent with what he (Shultz) has taught for years as an economist,"" but said they don't necessarily relate to the Soviet Union. Amstutz could not be reached for comment, and an aide to Lyng said Lyng would not comment on Shultz's statements. But trade sources were hopeful that the Shultz comments may indicate some movement towards EEP wheat to Moscow. ""If he didn't say no, then there's a chance. This is potentially a positive development,"" a commodity source said."
ec to abolish tax on spanish maize exports,grain corn,"The European Community Commission has decided to abolish a special tax of eight Ecus per tonne imposed on exports of Spanish maize, Commission sources said. They said the tax, which applies to Spanish sales to EC and non-EC countries alike, would no longer be required on exports from Spanish ports south of Valencia. The decision was taken at a meeting of the authority's cereals management committee today. The tax had been introduced last September at the same time as a subsidy of eight Ecus per tonne was brought in for exports of maize to Spain from other EC member countries. The aim of the tax was to prevent the maize imported into Spain from the other EC states with the help of subsidies from being reexported back to them. The sources added that Spain had received no answer from the committee to its request that tenders be opened for the sale to third countries of 450,000 tonnes of maize. The request will be considered at the committee's next meeting, the commission sources said. Madrid estimates that it needs to import 1.7 mln tonnes of maize this year, while an EC-U.S. accord guarantees non-EC producer sales to Spain of two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum annually for the next four years."
congressmen urge u.s. soybean program changes,oilseed soybean,"Several leading farm-state Congressmen said they will press the U.S. Agriculture Department to implement some kind of marketing loan to make soybeans exports competitive while protecting farm income. Speaking at a House grains subcommittee hearing, chairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan., proposed that Congressmen and representatives of soybean growers meet with USDA on the subject in the next two weeks. ""Let's see if we can try to push them (USDA) to do something without legislation,"" Glickman told the hearing. The current soybean loan rate effectively is 4.56 dlrs per bushel with no income protection, or marketing loan. David Haggard, American Soybean Association, ASA, president said USDA must make changes in the soybean program. The current soybean program ""gave us the worst of both worlds,"" ASA's Haggard told the hearing. The 1987 loan rate is too high relative to corn and is encouraging an expansion of soybean production in South America, he said. At the same time, the U.S. soybean loan rate is too low to provide any income support for soybean farmers, Haggard said. ""We need some kind of market loan,"" he added. The 1985 farm bill provides authority for the Agriculture Secretary to implement a marketing loan for soybeans but USDA so far has resisted pressure to use the authority. Representatives of ASA met earlier this month with USDA, but Haggard said USDA officials gave no indication if they would seriously consider offering a marketing loan. USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz yesterday said the soybean situation is a ""dilemna"" which has been studied extensively by the department. But he did not say what, if any changes, are under consideration. In his testimony, Haggard indicated there are ways other than a marketing loan which should be considered to help soybean growers, such as a so-called producer option payment, or a direct payment program. Haggard said barring any program changes, Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC, soybean stocks, now at 385 mln bu, will rise to 500 mln by the end of August. A further 100 mln bu of soybeans could be forfeited between September and end-year. ""Thus, CCC could own the equivalent of Brazil's entire soybean crop by the end of calendar year 1987,"" Haggard said. However, Haggard said that the U.S. should be cautious in making soybean program changes that might allow the European Community to challenge the U.S. program under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT. He noted that The EC imports one quarter of U.S. soybean production and loss of that market would be devastating. The Reagan administration has given ""mixed signals"" on whether it believes a marketing loan for soybeans could be successfully challenged in GATT by the EC, Haggard said. While the ASA position is to support a 5.02 dlrs per bu loan rate combined with a marketing loan, Haggard also endorsed a proposal by Rep. Jerry Huckaby, D-La., which would set a six dlrs per bu loan rate and apply a marketing loan. The Huckaby proposal is also supported by the ranking Republican on the House Agriculture committee, Rep. Edward Madigan of Illinois. Subcommittee chairman Glickman endorsed the need to take some action on soybeans, but cautioned that the marketing loan could mean a substantial increase in budget costs. Glickman noted that the Agriculture Committee must cut one to 1.5 billion dlrs from its fiscal 1988 budget and therefore must fit any soybean program changes into the overall budget. Haggard said at a soybean loan rate of six dlrs per bu combined with a marketing loan, the U.S. soybean price might fall to four dlrs per bu initially. This would cost the government a maximum of two billion dlrs. But he said the costs would decline as market prices recovered."
"sprinkel urges greater growth in japan, europe",trade money-fx,"Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of the president's council of economic advisors, said stronger domestic demand growth in Japan and Western Europe is needed to help stimulate U.S. exports without having to rely on futher dollar declines. ""Stronger domestic demand growth in the major foreign industrial countries is needed to engender the much needed expansion of U.S. export markets without having to rely on further dollar depreciation,"" he told the Futures Industry Association. Sprinkel said the recent recovery of domestic demand in Japan and Europe has been one of the weakest in the post-war period. ""Stronger domestic demand growth in the major industrial countries would help give balance to the current world recovery,"" he said. Asked if Japan was not living up to commitments made last month to trading partners, he said recent figures showed Japan's economy grew by about 0.5 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986, ""Not enough to sustain employment growth."" However, Sprinkel said Japan had not reneged on its pledges and was moving toward more stimulative policies, including tax reform. ""I suspect there will be further moves,"" he said. Sprinkel repeated his call for further cuts in U.S. government spending and for resistance to tax increases. ""Reducing the federal government budget deficit by expenditure restraint is needed to preserve the low marginal tax rates achieved by tax reform,"" he said, adding that ""a vote to increase to government expenditures is a vote against tax reform."" Sprinkel said the fall of the dollar had substantially restored U.S. cost competitiveness and that the deterioration of the U.S. trade balance appeared to have abated. However, he said that ""sole reliance on dollar depreciation to reduce our trade deficit is not desirable,"" as it risks inflation in the United States and recession abroad. ""I am confident that further improvements in our trade performance will contribute significantly to growth in 1987,"" he said. Improvements in the U.S. trade balance, he said, will come about largely from a swing in manufactures trade and present ""serious adjustment problems for U.S. trading partners."" Western Europe, where manufactures output and employment have been weak, promises to be especially hard hit by the improvement in the U.S. trade balance, Sprinkel said. He defended flexible exchange rates saying wide swings in rates were not a fault of the system but of the undesirable policies that produced them."
"usda reports corn sold to ussr, taiwan",grain corn,"The U.S. Agriculture Department said private U.S. exporters reported new sales of 900,000 tonnes of corn to the Soviet Union and 350,000 tonnes of corn switched from previously announced unknown destinations to the USSR. The corn is for delivery during the 1986/87 marketing year and under the fourth year of the U.S.-USSR Long Term Grain Supply Agreement, the USDA said. The department said exporters also reported corn sales of 143,000 tonnes for delivery to Taiwan, with 56,000 tonnes for shipment in the 1986/87 season and the balance for shipment in the 1987/88 year. The marketing year for corn began September 1. Sales of corn to the USSR for delivery during the fourth year of the agreement, which ends this September 30, now total 2.25 mln tonnes."

"amoco <an> oil reserves down, gas up in 1986",crude nat-gas,"Amoco Corp's petroleum liquids reserves total 2.42 billion barrels at the end of 1986, down from 2.77 billion a year earlier, but its natural gas reserves increased to 15.37 trillion cubic feet from 15.14 trillion, the company's annual report said. It said the drop in crude oil and natural gas liquid reserves reflected downward revisions of previous estimates caused by the sharp drop in oil prices last year. This accounted for 178 mln barrels of a worldwide downward revision of 188 mln barrels, with 158 mln barrels of the total revision occurring in the United States, the report said. Amoco said there were upward revisions in the size of its worldwide gas reserves totalling 404 billion cubic feet last year, while it discovered 568 billion cubic feet and purchased 298 billion cubic feet of reserves. Production of one trillion cubic feet offset much of these gains, the report said. All of the gas reserve purchases, as well as all of the 14 mln barrels of oil reserves bought in 1986, were in the United States, Amoco said, noting it has spent 1.1 billion dlrs to acquire U.S. producing properties over the past three years. Commenting on 1987, Amoco said acquisitions ""will be an integral part of our strategy, should reserves become available at attractive prices."" The company said it expects ""the marketing climate for natural gas to improve in 1987, which should provide the opportunity for Amoco to expand sales. As prices and demand improve, we are poised to accelerate capital spending on our inventory of attractive opportunities."" Amoco previously announced a 1987 capital spending budget of 3.2 billion dlrs. Such spending totaled 3.18 billion dlrs last year, down from 5.31 billion in 1985."

Lawson said in a television interview that he did not regard the pound's present exchange rate was uncomfortably high. ""I think it is round about right,"" he said. ""I think there was a time that they (British manufacturers) thought the (exchange) rate was uncomfortably high. But I think they are very satisfied with the present level.""

shultz not opposed to wheat subsidy to soviets,grain wheat,"Secretary of State George Shultz has decided not to oppose any U.S. wheat subsidy offer to the Soviet Union and has left the final decision on whether to sell subsidized wheat to Moscow up to President Reagan and the Agriculture Department, a State Department official said. ""Shultz feels like he fought the battle against a subsidy last summer, and he's not going to the mat again. It's now basically the USDA who has to make their decisions as to what they want to do,"" the official said. If USDA decides to go ahead with a subsidy offer to the Soviet Union, he said, ""Shultz will not wage a vigorous campaign against it. He might not come out in favor of it, but he won't go to the President and voice his objections."" In an official statement clarifying Shultz's remarks yesterday to leaders of the National Association of Wheat Growers, the State Department said, ""Secretary Shultz expressed his belief that whenever possible, U.S. grain should be competitive on world markets, including the Soviet Union. The Agriculture Department is in the best position to determine whether consideration should be given at this time to extending to the Soviets a subsidy under the Export Enhancement Program."" Although Shultz will not oppose a wheat subsidy to the Soviets, there remain obstacles to another subsidy offer to Moscow, the State Department official said. ""Everyone in the government agrees that if there is a subsidy to be offered, we would not offer it unless we had a firm commitment from the Soviets that they would buy."" USDA does not want a repetition of last summer when the USSR baulked at its offer of four mln tonnes of subsidized wheat, the official, who asked not to be identified, said. The Soviets rejected the U.S. offer then on the grounds that the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy was insufficient to bring U.S. prices down to competitive levels. The Soviets want a higher subsidy offer this time, the State Department source said. ""What the Soviets want is something equivalent to the lowest price being paid by anyone in the world,"" he said. The Soviets argue that they are the best customer of the U.S. and that they are entitled to the best price, he said. Government and commodity sources also said there are elements in the USDA, most notably undersecretary Daniel Amstutz, who remain opposed to a wheat subsidy to the Soviets. ""Subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union is still not a foregone conclusion,"" the State Department official said."
fed data suggest u.s. credit policy is on hold,money-supply interest,"Latest Federal Reserve data suggest that the U.S. banking system is flush with reserves going into a period of traditional tightness and that overall monetary policy is on hold, economists said. ""There is ample liquidity.... The Fed is not going to shift gears at the present time or for at least another month,"" said Maria Ramirez of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ""Technical and seasonal considerations aside, there is nothing for the (credit) market to get excited about,"" added Robert di Clemente of Salomon Brothers Inc. Adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed's discount window averaged only 228 mln dlrs a day in the first week of the bank statement period ending next Wednesday, compared with 233 mln and 451 mln in the first weeks of the previous two periods. Another sign of abundant liquidity was the upward revision in banks' net free reserves in the two-week period to March 11 to a daily average of 759 mln dlrs from an estimated 660 mln. Finally, a Fed spokesman told a press briefing that the 14 money center banks were absent from the Fed's discount window for the third week running, with the latest week's borrowing split between the large regional and the smaller banks. While modest open market intervention was apparently enough to defuse any funding pressures in the first week of the latest statement period, economists predicted that the Fed would have to be more aggressive in coming weeks. The Fed injected temporary reserves directly and indirectly on four of the five trading days via system and customer repurchase agreements. ""Fed funds will be coming under relatively intense pressure,"" said Salomon's di Clemente, noting the approaching month- and quarter-end and the round of holidays and tax dates in April. ""The Fed is faced with a large seasonal adding requirement,"" said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc, who expects a permanent bill purchase next week and a coupon purchase in early April. Economists were also heartened by further signs of a deceleration in money supply growth, not only in the largely discredited M-1 gauge but also in the more closely watched M-2 and M-3 aggregates. M-1 grew a mere 500 mln dlrs in the week to March nine, compared with private forecasts of a 2.3 mln dlr rise. Weekly M-2 and M-3 components also hinted at slower overall growth. ""The M-1 increase was surprisingly modest and I suspect we are on our way to another moderate set of M-2 and M-3 figures for March,"" said Salomon's di Clemente. Merrill's McCarthy said they could even come in below the bottom of their respective target ranges. In February, M-2 was 18.2 billion dlrs below its upper limit and M-3 was 20.8 billion beneath. Noting Fed Vice Chairman Johnson's encouraging remarks on inflation today and recent interest rate cuts overseas, some economists suggested this slowing in monetary growth could lend support to calls for further accommodation here. ""Our belief is that we could still get a move downwards in rates before anything else,"" said Salomon's di Clemente, adding that the key swing factor will continue to be the strength of the U.S. economy. Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank agreed that the economy's health would remain the main influence on policy but, contrary to di Clemente, he said that recent signs of faster growth and inflation could lead to higher rates first. Drexel's Ramirez did not commit herself either way, adding that the next major move may have to wait until April 14 when February's U.S. trade data are due for release."
e.c. official says fate of veg oil tax uncertain,veg-oil oilseed soybean,"Whether the European Community's Council of Ministers will approve a proposed tax on vegetable oils that has sparked threats of U.S. retaliation is uncertain, an EC official said. ""It is very far from certain that it will go through,"" Sir Roy Denman, Head of the EC Delegation in Washington, told reporters before he addressed the Foreign Trade Association. Denman noted Britain remains opposed to the plan and West Germany has opposed it in the past. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter has threatened retaliation if the tax is approved, as it would limit U.S. soybean exports to the EC. Council action is expected soon. Denman said while the EC is willing to negotiate about agriculture in a new round of trade talks, it is unwilling to single out export subsidies on a negotiating agenda or put agricultural policy on a special fast track. ""The key to a solution in this area seems to me not in the framing of the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) wording...but in tackling government subsidies to farmers on both sides of the Atlantic,"" he said."
volcker says u.s. trade deficit is major challenge,trade bop,"Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said the U.S. Trade deficit is a challenge for the U.S. Equal to the Soviet Union launching of Sputnik. ""The international challenge implicit in our huge trade deficit has become the 1980s equivalent to the launch of Sputnik by the Russians in the 1950s, when we suddenly feared we were to be left in the wake of Soviet technological achievement,"" he said in an address to Florida educators. He said the trade problem underscored the need to reform the U.S. Educational system to improve economic performance. The Commerce Department reported last week that the nation's trade gap, calculated on a balance-of-payments basis, swelled to a record 38.37 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter, bringing the 1986 deficit to a record 147.71 billion dlrs. Volcker called on educators to stress the development of basic reading, writing and mathematics skills and urged them to help students adapt to the fast-changing economic climate. Volcker said the challenge was greatest in the education of low-income minority groups such as blacks and Hispanics."
short-term yen interest rates seen falling soon,money-fx interest,"Japanese short-term interest rates, buoyed recently by seasonal factors, are likely to fall from the beginning of April when the new financial year begins, money traders said. The Bank of Japan is expected to encourage the trend following its attempts to pressure rates to enhance its discount rate cut on February 23, they said. The Bank cut the rate to 2.5 pct from three, and began actively injecting funds into the money market to offset rate rises resulting from the end-of-fiscal-year surge in demand for funds from financial institutions. Despite its attempts to dampen rates with measures such as aggressive commercial bill purchases, the central bank has failed to remove all upward pressure, money traders said. Attractive interest rates offered by domestic banks to compete for time deposits of more than 600 mln yen has underpinned short-term rates, they said. Interest rates on time deposits of more than 600 mln yen were decontrolled by the Finance Ministry last September. This resulted in such deposits with domestic banks rising to 17,830 billion yen by the end-December, a three-fold increase on end-December 1985 levels, bankers said. On March 31, the money market expects to see a 2,000 billion yen surplus resulting from government payment of fiscal funds, money traders said. From April 1, they predict the unconditional call rate will fall to 3.5000 pct from 3.7500 pct today and the one-month commercial bill discount rate to drop to 3.7500 pct from 4.0635 pct. They predict the three-month bill discount rate to slip to 3.875 pct from 4.0000 today and the three-month certificate of deposit rate to slide to 4.10/4.15 from 4.35/25."

economic spotlight - asian droughts,grain rice wheat tea sugar,"Three geographically diverse droughts in Asia are being linked by some scientists to a reintensification of the complex and little-understood El Nino weather pattern, <Accu-Weather Inc>, a commercial weather forecasting service, said. Rice and wheat farmers in China, wheat and sugarcane growers in Australia and tea planters in Sri Lanka all face serious losses to their respective harvests unless rains arrive in time to break the droughts, offical reports, government officials and meteorologists said. Wen Wei Po, a Hong Kong daily with close Peking links, said the drought is the worst in over 20 years and some provinces have been without adequate rainfall for more than seven months. Rice planting is threatened in eight provinces, it added. Rainfall in the key farming provinces of Henan and Sichuan was 70 pct below average during February, the lowest figure for over 20 years, the paper said. The dry weather has cut stored water volumes by over 20 pct compared with last March and lowered the water levels of many rivers, it added. This has resulted in reduced hydro-electric power, causing shortages to industry and households. The upper reaches of the Yangtze are at their lowest levels in a century, causing many ships to run aground, Wen Wei Po said. Unusually high temperatures have also been reported across China, media reports said. The People's Daily said Sichuan has recorded temperatures three degrees Celsius higher than average since early February. The New China News Agency said the average December temperature in Harbin in the northeast was six degrees higher than last December and 14 degrees higher than December 1984. Severe drought is affecting about one-third of Sri Lanka and threatens to reduce the country's tea crop, Ministry of Plantation Industries officials told Reuters In Australia, concern is growing about below-average rainfall levels in parts of the sugarcane belt along the Queensland coast and in Western Australia's wheat belt, local Meteorological Bureau officials said. For many farmers and government officials the fear is that while the present low rainfall does not yet pose a major threat, the prospect of a dry autumn/winter season when the wheat crop is in its early stages certainly does, they added. Concern is heightened by the memory of the 1982/83 drought which devastated the wheat crop and coincided with the occurrence of the barely understood weather phenomenon known as El Nino, they said. Although meteorologists are cautious about linking the Asia-Pacific region's disrupted weather patterns to any single cause, El Nino's role is being closely studied, they said. Accu-Weather Inc, which specialises in providing data for agriculture and shipping interests, said each El Nino 'event' was unique. The El Nino does not always produce the same effects and the present occurrence is much less pronounced than the last major event in 1982/83, it said. El Nino, Spanish for ""Christ Child"" because it appears around Christmas, is formed by the action of warm air, bearing clouds and rain, shifting from the Indonesian archipelago to the coast of Peru, where it mingles with the cold waters associated with the Peru current and returns across the Pacific as the trade winds, meteorologists said. The winds, strengthened by El Nino's ""pump"" effect, raise the sea level off Australia and Indonesia, they said. When the winds drop, the ocean, seeking equilibrium, sends a surge of warmer water back across the Pacific where it collides with the cold seas off Peru, they said. One effect of this heat exchange is to deflect the rain-bearing clouds away from Australia and Indonesia into the Pacific, where they further disrupt other weather patterns. The prospects for an end to the droughts vary, Accu-Weather said. China, where the affected areas have received between 40 and 75 pct of normal rainfall, will have to wait for the May-September rains, it said. The May-September rains normally provide the drought-striken areas with 80 pct of annual rainfall. In Australia, areas of Queensland's coastal strip have received less than half the normal rainfall during the current wet season, but prospects for increased rains are diminishing as the rainy season draws to an end. In Sri Lanka, the drought has come when rainfall should be at its maximum for the year. The year's secondary rains usually occur between April and June, although it is not possible at this stage to forecast whether they will arrive as usual."

Bhagat said the FCI had a total of 16.43 mln tonnes of food grains in its warehouses at the end of 1986. It had asked state governments to build more warehouses to avoid damage to grains."

All bids for wheat were rejected. However, the total to date of 5.06 mln tonnes is still substantially more than the 3.03 mln under licence a year ago. The 80,000 tonnes of French maize granted for export moved the total to 135,000 tonnes since the tender opened in February this year. There were no facilities for maize in the previous weekly grain export series."

The spokesman, speaking from Bonn, said, ""We have good reason to think West Germany holds to its resistance to the proposed tax."" Several top government officials told the American Soybean Association and the National Soybean Processors Association delegations there was no reason for American producers and processors to pay for EC agriculture, the spokesman said. European agriculture was facing severe problems, but both the Community and the U.S. Should work closely within the framework provided by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, he said. The delegations will continue their top level meetings in Bonn today but will not issue a statement before returning to the U.S. At the weekend. The EC and the U.S. Realised the tax issue would stay on the agenda for several months and there were indications that both sides would have to prepare for some tough negotiations, the spokesman said."
japan under attack over trade surplus,trade money-fx,"Japan's economic policies face fierce international attack as hopes fade of a substantial drop in its trade surplus, international monetary sources said. At a meeting this week in Paris, senior government officials from major nations are considering an Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) staff report that forecasts a continuing large Japanese trade surplus, they said. Though Japanese exports have become more expensive with the yen's sharp rise against the dollar, they still tend to surge when growth picks up, according to the OECD. As a solution, the OECD staff has urged Japan to redirect its export-driven economy, boosting domestic demand and imports by adopting a more flexible fiscal policy, they said. That recommendation echoes calls made recently at secret meetings of the International Monetary Fund's executive board. The monetary sources said Japan's policy was criticized when the board met to consider the country's economy under the annual consultations it holds with each of its members. The United States, which until recently has been reluctant to criticize Japan's fiscal stance, joined in the attack, he said. The IMF staff has also cast doubt on the Japanese government's forecast of 3.5 pct economic growth in the fiscal year beginning April 1. Most independent forecasters, including the IMF, believe that growth in calendar 1987 will be below three pct, monetary sources said. The Finance Ministry has been particularly sensitive to such criticism because it is already under mounting domestic pressure to boost an economy hard-hit by the yen's rise. The yen's climb has lost exporters sales and profits in the huge American market. Tokyo is also eager to avoid any suggestion that a further yen rise might be needed to cut its trade surplus, which last year amounted to a record 93 billion dlrs. Japan cannot tolerate a further rise of the yen, Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari said recently. The yen closed here today at 151.53 to the dollar. Most Japanese politicians, including Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, are clearly hoping the yen will weaken, government officials said. At a meeting in Paris last month, Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the United States and West Germany, agreed to cooperate to hold currencies at around current levels. Officials said that wording represented a compromise. Miyazawa hopes the agreement will hold the yen stable for a few months, before it weakens later in the year. Japan wanted the Paris communique to imply a higher value for the dollar, perhaps by substituting the word ""recent"" for ""current,"" while the United States wanted it to more clearly point to the dollar's weaker levels now, perhaps by use of the word ""present,"" they said. In the months leading up the February 22 agreement, the dollar dropped some 10 yen. The officials also sought to discredit suggestions in the market that recent U.S. Action to prevent the dollar from rising above 1.87 marks pointed to a 153 to 155 yen ceiling for the U.S. Currency. Japan has also attacked OECD forecasts, which it says do not take account of the structural changes in the Japanese economy that will be triggered by the strong yen. Officials said there are already signs of that. More and more companies have announced plans to move production facilities offshore to take advantage of cheaper costs abroad, they said."
volcker says trade deficit is major challenge,trade bop,"Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said the U.S. Trade deficit is a challenge for the U.S. Equal to the Soviet Union launching of Sputnik. ""The international challenge implicit in our huge trade deficit has become the 1980s equivalent to the launch of Sputnik by the Russians in the 1950s, when we suddenly feared we were to be left in the wake of Soviet technological achievement,"" he said in an address to Florida educators. He said the trade problem underscored the need to reform the U.S. Educational system to improve economic performance. The Commerce Department reported last week that the nation's trade gap, calculated on a balance-of-payments basis, swelled to a record 38.37 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter, bringing the 1986 deficit to a record 147.71 billion dlrs. Volcker called on educators to stress the development of basic reading, writing and mathematics skills and urged them to help students adapt to the fast-changing economic climate. Volcker said the challenge was greatest in the education of low-income minority groups such as blacks and Hispanics."

geodome sets idaho gold/silver mine construction,gold silver,"Geodome Resources Ltd said following receipt of a feasibility study from Raytheon Co's Stearns Catalytic unit it will proceed with construction and pre-production stripping at its Sunbeam Mine in Custer County, Idaho, as quickly as possible. The company said the study found proven ore reserves of 3,302,000 short tons grading 0.077 ounce of gold per ton. It said the mine will operate at a rate of 626,000 tons of ore per year, with higher-grade ore being mined in the first three years for a rapid payback of capital costs. It said the feasibility study calls for gold production averaging 41,000 ounces a year for the life of the mine and 50,000 ounces a year over the first three years, with 99,000 ounces of silver per year being produced over the mine life. Capital costs would be 22.3 mln dlrs with all-new equipment and 500,000 to one mln dlrs less with used equipment, the firm said. It said the mine would be operated by a contract miner but the associated mill by Geodome. Geodome said a new ore zone discovered last summer is not included in reserve calculations. It said eight of the nine holes drilled there have an average grade of 0.046 ounce of gold and 2.1 ounces of silver per ton. Also excluded are reserves of 1,400,000 tons of low-grade material that could be milled profitably at 425 dlrs a ton for gold. The feasibility study used a 350 dlr gold price. Geodome said operating costs of the mine will average 201 dlr per ounce of gold for the mine life and 171 dlrs for the first three years, in constant dollars."

keating sees lower australian current deficit,trade bop,"Australian Treasurer Paul Keating said he expects the country's 1986/87 current account deficit to be one billion dlrs lower than the 14.7 billion forecast in the August budget. Keating told a financiers' dinner that February's 750 mln dlr deficit, against January's 1.23 billion, was ""in the groove"" of the government's expectations. ""We will probably bring the current account this year under 14 billion, I think, which will probably be about a billion dollars less than we forecast in the budget,"" Keating said. ""I am sure we will see a lower current account deficit for next year ... And a fall as proportion of GDP."" Australia posted a 13.82 billion dlr current account deficit in 1985/86 and Keating said the latest monthly figures showed an encouraging trend. Keating said the government would maintain responsible economic management regardless of whether it was drawn into an election, because it would take time to stabilise Australia's 80 billion dlr foreign debt. ""We have to build the import competing sector back,"" he said. ""We are now trying to rebuild our capital structure. We are trying to rebuild the culture of productivity and manufacturing."" Keating said the foundation for a transition of the economy had been laid with the floating of the Australian dollar and continued with wage restraint and deregulation. The Government would follow with spending cuts in its economic statement on May 14, he said."

talking point/first city bancorporation <fbt>,earn crude,"First City Bancorporation's sale of 54 mln dlrs in oil loans to Prudential-Bache should significantly reduce its energy problems, but the bank's losses are still virtually guaranteed to continue, analysts said. The package of energy loans was sold at book value, so First City did not to show a gain or loss, said bank spokesman James Day. He added it was possible First City would sell more of the bank's remaining 1.4 billion dlrs in oil-related loans to raise cash. The loans had been made by First City to oil producers and to oilfield service and supply companies. Day said some had already been classified as nonperforming, or charged off as a loss, but he could not identify how many were included in those categories. The loans were purchased by Prudential Bache's Energy Growth Fund, a limited partnership created last month with 90 mln dlrs in funding to invest in oil and gas properties. First City, the big Texas bank hit hardest by the downturn in oil prices, lost a record 402 mln dlrs in fiscal year 1986 and has said it is seeking a merger partner or some other capital assistance. The Houston-based bank's nonperforming assets totaled 897.1 mln dlrs at yearend, up from 563.1 mln dlrs at the end of 1985 Analysts have said no buyer is likely to be interested in the troubled bank unless government assistance is available. ""Their problems are not just limited to energy. They have a substantial portfolio in real estate. This sale in and of itself won't make the company look better to a potential buyer,"" said Ray Archibold, a banking analyst with McCarthy, Crisanti and Maffei Inc. ""It does reduce the bank's exposure in energy loans and 54 mln dlrs is a substantial amount,"" Archibold said, ""but the deal represents only about four pct of their energy loans."" Of First City's total loan portfolio of 9.9 mln dlrs, about 14 pct or 1.4 billion dlrs were made to energy producers or suppliers, analysts said. Its record losses have been caused by its past status as one of the nation's top lenders to oil and gas producers and suppliers during the boom days of the late 1970s and early 1980s. First City said about half of the loans sold to Prudential came from its Energy Finance Co., an entity formed in 1982 to loan money to ""more venturesome"" oil borrowers that promised a higher potential return. The other half of the loans were from First City's lead bank in Houston. Chris Kotowski, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co., said the sale of the package of energy loans was the first encouraging news from First City in months. ""It's not going to solve all of First City's problems but it's a good transaction for them. It may be possible for them to sell additional loans,"" Kotowski said. ""Prudential can fund these things more cheaply than First City and there's an incentive to invest in troubled energy companies right now as values are depressed"" In a statement, First City chairman J.A. Elkins said the bank's strategy was to reduce the proportion of energy loans to total loans. ""This move, which we believe is the first transaction of its kind, helps us further, and we were able to make it without suffering a loss."""

houston metals' mine yields positive results,silver copper lead zinc gold strategic-metal,"<Houston Metals Corp> said the the first phase of the underground rehabilitation, extensive drilling and bulk sampling program at its Silver Queen Mine has yielded positive results. Houston said representative assays from the 2,750 ft and 2,600 ft levels at the south end of the mine established ore deposits in the following ranges: copper, 3.7 pct to 5.08 pct, lead .99 pct to 1.5 pct, zinc six pct to 9.6 pct, silver 15.63 pct to 79.92 oz per ton, gold .062 to .19 oz per ton, germanium 93 to 103 grams per ton, gallium five to 18 grams per ton. In addition, Houston Metals said the weighted average of 25 diamond-drilled holes 375 ft below the 2,600 foot level and 800 ft along the strike assayed gold at .237 oz per ton, silver at 10.91 oz per ton and zinc at 8.99 pct. An apparent parallel vein structure at the 2,600 ft level returned similar values, the company said. It added that preliminary metallurgical tests from representative bulk ore samples indicate the commercial feasability of producing a zinc and a copper-lead concentrate. Houston Metals said gold, silver and the base metals have recoveries of 90 pct to 95 pct, with 95 pct of gold recovered from better gold ores, while gallium, germanium and indium have recoveries of between 66 pct to 82 pct and are included in the zinc concentrate. The company's 1987 program of diamond drilling, underground drifting and metallurgical evaluation is scheduled to start on April. Houston Metals said it has a 60 pct interest in the Silver Queen mines. It added that funds for the program have been provided by First Exploration Fund, a Canadian limited partnership sponsored by Merrill Lynch Canada Inc and Dominion Securities Inc."
usda not planning any major pricing changes,grain corn ship,"The Agriculture Department is not considering any major changes in its pricing system for posted county prices, an Agriculture Department offical said. ""We do not have current plans to make any major adjustments or changes in our pricing,"" said Bob Sindt, USDA assistant deputy administrator for commodity operations. U.S. grain traders and merchandisers said earlier this week USDA might act soon to reduce the cash corn price premium at the Gulf versus interior price levels by dropping ASCS posted prices to encourage interior PIK and roll movement. But Sindt denied USDA is planning any such changes. ""If people are suggesting that we are going to make wholesale changes in pricing, we are not considering this,"" he said. Sindt, however, did not rule out the possiblity of implementing more minor changes in its pricing system. ""We are continually monitoring the whole nationwide structure to maintain its accuracy,"" he said. ""If we become convinced that we need to make a change, then appropriate adjustments will be made."" Sindt acknowledged that concern has been voiced that USDA's price differentials between the New Orleans Gulf and interior markets are not accurate because of higher than normal barge freight rates. He said commodity operations deputy administrator Ralph Klopfenstein is currently in the midwest on a speaking tour and will meet with ASCS oficials in Kansas City next week. Sindt said a number of issues will be discussed at that meeting, including the current concern over the gulf corn premiums. He defended the USDA differentials, saying that these price margins reflect an average of prices throughout the year and that seasonal factors will normally cause prices to increase or decrease. The USDA official also said that only those counties that use the Gulf to price grain are being currently affected by the high barge freight tariffs and increased gulf prices. When asked if the USDA emergency storage program which allows grain to be stored in barges was taking up barge space and accounting for the higher freight rates, Sindt discounted the idea. He said USDA has grain left in only about 250 barges and that, under provisions of the program, these all have to be emptied by the end of March."
leading economists call for more growth abroad,trade money-fx,"A panel of four leading economists told a congressional hearing today that foreign economies will need to expand to avoid recession as the U.S. trade deficit declines. C. Fred Bergsten, a former senior Treasury Department official, and Robert Solomon of the Brookings Institution told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the major exporting countries risk recession if they do not expand because U.S. demand for imports is expected to fall. ""They need to beef up domestic demand as their trade surplus falls,"" or unemployment will keep growing, Bergsten said. Bergsten predicted the U.S. trade deficit, which hit 169 billion dlrs last year, will fall 30-40 billion dlrs a year for the next two years as a result of the dollar's 35-40 pct decline since September 1985. The government should intervene to push the dollar down further if the previous declines do not lead to an improvement in the trade picture, if the U.S. budget deficit is not reduced and if foreign expansion does not occur, he added. Solomon said the dollar must fall further to compensate for the huge interest payments required on U.S. foreign debt. The Paris agreement between the major industrialized countries provided only for a pause in its decline, he said. Rimmer de Vries, senior vice president of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., said the U.S. trade deficit problem is a problem of lagging growth in industrial economies, prolonged currency misalignment, debt problems of the developing countries, and unbalanced growth in the Asian industrializing countries. John Makin of the American Enterprise Institute, suggested foreign tax cuts to increase demand and pick up the slack from the U.S. trade deficit fall."

ftc urges veto of georgia gasoline station bill,gas crude,The Federal Trade Commission said its staff has urged the governor of Georgia to veto a bill that would prohibit petroleum refiners from owning and operating retail gasoline stations. The proposed legislation is aimed at preventing large oil refiners and marketers from using predatory or monopolistic practices against franchised dealers. But the FTC said fears of refiner-owned stations as part of a scheme of predatory or monopolistic practices are unfounded. It called the bill anticompetitive and warned that it would force higher gasoline prices for Georgia motorists.

Cook also said it began preliminary talks with private investors looking to buy a stock position in order to provide Cook with additional cash and assist its posture in its negotation with its banks. Cook is negotiating with its bank lenders and private sources for a borrowing facility to relieve its current working capital requirements. Cook said it believes the reasons for its losses since OCtober have been identified and are mostly non-recurring.

Hudson's Bay holds about four mln shares of Dome's 10 pct series one cumulative subordinate convertible preferred shares. Last March, Dome suspended payment of dividends on all preferred shares until June 1, 1987. The shares give the holder the right to convert to Dome common shares at 3.33 dlrs per share. Dome has the right to force conversion if Dome common reaches 3.885 dlrs per share. Dome is trading at 1.12 dlrs per share, down one ct, today on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Hudson's Bay also said it had an increase in 1986 in retail operating profit to 185.3 mln dlrs from 111.4 mln dlrs, but that was partially offset by an increase of 14.9 mln dlrs in interest costs and 25.3 mln dlrs in taxes.

"concern over ""el nino"" in peru - usda report",grain rice corn cotton,"There are heightened fears that ""El Nino"" may be returning to Peru with an intensity approaching the 1983 disaster, which affected the weather on several continents and caused widespread damage through floods and drought, the U.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Lima said in a field report. Continued heavy rains in the northern coastal area, flooding of several major rivers and mud slides have led to increased concern, the report, dated March 17, said. However, it said official sources still believe that this year's El Nino will have only weak to moderate intensity. EL Nino is a phenomenon involving a shift in winds and waters in the pacific. The USDA report said that so far the El Nino now being experienced has not had an overall negative impact on agricultural production. Excessive rains in the Piura Pima cotton area may reduce yields by about 20 pct due to excessive growth too early in the crop cycle. Also insect damage to crops could be more extensive where excessive moisture exists, it said. However, the El Nino has resulted in a much improved supply of irrigation water in the major dams which will improve prospects for many crucial crops such as rice and corn, and slow the decline in sugar production, it said. If El Nino picks up momentum, Peru's fishing industry could receive a setback. But trade sources still believe the fish catch for industrial processing will reach 5.5 mln tonnes in 1987, almost 20 pct above last year, the report said. Water temperatures in the northern fishing areas are three to four degrees centigrade above normal but still not high enough to drive the fish to cooler southern waters, it said. It said there is still the outside chance that El Nino will intensify and carry on through late March, April and May causing problems as crops approach harvest. ""There appears to be no way to project the course of El Nino -- only time will tell,"" the report said."

bally <bly> seen selling off health unit,earn acq,"Bally Manufacturing Corp's proposed public offering of 24 pct of its Health and Tennis Corp unit is seen as the first step towards the sale of the entire unit, analysts said. ""In the longer-term horizon, Bally wants to concentrate on its gaming businesses,"" said analyst Dennis Forst of Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. Last week, Bally said it was considering the sale of another non-casino unit, its Six Flags amusement park unit, which analysts said could fetch about 300 mln dlrs. Bally spokesman Bill Peltier said ""the company currently has no hard plans to the sell any more of the health club company, but in the long term we'll wait and see how the offering goes."" Once Bally's biggest revenue producer, the health club unit had 1986 operating income of 60 mln dlrs on revenues of 456.2 mln dlrs, 28 pct of Bally's revenues. Analysts estimate the unit could be sold for for 300-500 mln dlrs. Analysts said Bally's decision to offer shares in the unit could be the first step to selling it. ""It would seem obvious that an offering would decrease the health club unit's debt, increase its cash flow and operating income, making it an attractive buy to a third party,"" Steven Eisenberg of Bear Stearns said. On Monday, Bally said it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial offering of 24 pct, or 5.8 mln shares, of the unit's common stock at 13-15 dlrs a share. About half the proceeds, 40 mln dlrs, will be used to reduce parent Bally Manufacturing's debt which has swelled to 1.6 billion dlrs due to recent hotel acquisitions and the purchase of shares from Donald Trump who had threatened a hostile takeover, according to Bally treasurer Paul Johnson. Remaining proceeds from the stock offering and from a separate offering of 50 mln dlrs of 20-year convertible subordinated debt would be used to repay about 75 mln dlrs of short term senior bank debt of the health chain unit, a Bally spokesperson said. Analysts said Bally's health club unit's profits have remained strong, but are skeptical about the industry's long range prospects. ""The fitness club industry, over the last 10 years, has grown tremendously, but the question is whether its a fad or a permanent part of our lifestyle,"" said Eisenberg of Bear Stearns. Analysts said fitness clubs will likely flourish if the public stays at its peak of health consciousness, but that overcapacity is likely to occur as consumer enthusiasm wanes. In addition, ""the returns in the fitness club industry are just not as high as they are in the gaming industry,"" said one analyst. There are about 6,500 fitness clubs in the U.S., excluding clubs run by not-for-profit organizations, according to the Association of Physical Fitness Centers who estimates it to be an 8.0-billion-dlr-a-year industry. Asked if anyone has offered to buy the unit, which is the nation's largest health club chain, Peltier said, ""no one has the money to offer to buy it."" ""The fitness industry is a fragmented industry with no leader and there is a great opportunity for growth through acquisition and then standardization,"" said Wayne LaChapelle, chief financial officer of Livingwell INc <WELL>, the nation's second largest fitness chain operator whih LaChapelle said Livingwell is always interested in acquisition opportunities but ""could not afford an acquisition the size of Bally at this time."""
analyst says ussr winter grains hurt by weather,grain wheat corn,"The Soviet Union's winter grain crop is likely to have suffered losses due to dry planting conditions last fall and severe cold this winter, an analyst of world weather and crop conditions said. Grain analyst and meteorologist Gail Martell, author of the EF Hutton publication ""Global Crop News,"" said in her latest report that the Soviets may import more grain, possibly wheat, from the U.S. due to potential crop damage. ""Compared with last year, the outlook (for the Soviet winter grain crop) is far more pessimistic,"" she said. ""But it's still too early to talk about disastrous losses. A lot will depend on spring weather, not only for the outcome of the troubled winter grain crop, but also for spring planting."" Martell said the dry weather conditions last fall probably prevented optimal seed germination for winter grains. Key wheat growing areas of the southern Ukraine and North Caucasus received on 25-35 pct of autumn precipitation, she said. The bitter winter cold temperatures -- which broke record lows that had stood for four decades -- also may have taken its toll on Soviet winter crops, she said. However, she noted that most of the southern grain belt had ample snow cover, which should have well-insulated the majority of crop areas from severe frost damage. The USSR has already bought 20 to 21 mln tonnes of grains in the July 1986/June 1987 marketing year, primarily from Canada, the European Community, Argentina and Australia, Martell said. She cited a number of reasons besides possible crop problems that might point to additional Soviet import demand. Last fall's dry weather may limit livestock grazing on moisture-depleted pastures, while the cold winter weather necessitated supplemental feeding to keep livestock healthy. Martell was also skeptical of a Soviet claim for a 1986 grain harvest of 210 mln tonnes, and said the Chernobyl accident may have contaminated more grain than originally thought and have to be made up with imports. However, she said the U.S. remains a supplier of last resort for the Soviet Union, noting that the Soviets have only just recently begun their first U.S. grain purchases of the 1986/87 season by buying 2.25 mln tonnes of corn. Martell cited USDA statistics showing that since the 1980 grain embargo the U.S. is only a major supplier of grain to the USSR during years of heavy Soviet demand. In 1984/85, the U.S. supplied 41 pct of record Soviet grain imports of 55.5 mln tonnes. But in 1985/86, the Soviet Union bought 29.9 mln tonnes of grain and turned to the U.S. for only 24 pct of that total. While the USDA Soviet import target for grain for 1986/87 was 22 mln tonnes, many U.S. grain analysts have revised their estimates of Soviet imports up to 25-28 mln tonnes, she said."
ccc guarantees to turkey switched to meals-usda,oilseed meal-feed,"The Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC, has reallocated 15.0 mln dlrs in credit guarantees to Turkey previously earmarked for sales of U.S. oilseeds to provide coverage for sales of U.S. protein meals in fiscal year 1987, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. The department said the action reduces the guarantee line authorized for sales of oilseeds to 5.0 mln dlrs from 20.0 mln dlrs and creates the new line for protein meals. All sales under the credit lines must be registered and exports completed by September 30, 1987, it said."
ccc accepts export bonus on semolina to egypt,grain wheat,"The Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC, has accepted a bid for an export bonus to cover a sale of 6,000 tonnes of semolina to Egypt, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. The department said the semolina is for shipment April-October, 1987, and the bonus awarded was 224.87 dlrs per tonne. The bonus was made to International Multifoods Corp and will paid to the exporter in the form of commodities from CCC stocks, the department said. An additional 7,000 tonnes of semolina are still available to Egypt under the Export Enhancement Program initiative announced August 1, 1986, it said."
regency cruises <ship> sells ship interest,acq ship,"Regency Cruises Inc said it agreed to sell a 40 pct interest in the corporation that owns the M/V Regent Sea cruise ship for 2.1 mln dlrs to Monmouth International SA, which owns the other 60 pct. The company said it also extended a 1.7 mln dlr secured loan to Monmouth to finance completion of the renovation of another vessel, the M/V Regent Star, which is scheduled to begin operating in late June. Regency Cruises, which operates both ships, received a five-year extension, to November 1995, to the Regent Sea's original charter agreement, it said. It also received a reduction, to 600,000 dlrs from 1.6 mln dlrs, of its total charter guarantee for the Regent Sea and Regent Star. Regency also reported 1986 earnings of 5,695,000 dlrs or 37 cts a share on revenues of 40.9 mln dlrs. It began operations in November 1985. In addition, the company said its bank, Irving Bank Corp <V>, agreed to waive a one mln dlr counter guarantee for the bank to provide a 2.6 mln dlrs guarantee for Regency's Federal Maritime Commission bond. The company said after April 3 the exercise price of its warrants will return to two dlrs until they expire April 21. The price had been reduced to 1.50 dlrs for the three weeks ending April 3."
ldc food aid needs decline in 1986/87 - usda,grain wheat oilseed soybean veg-oil,"Total food aid needs in 69 of the least developed countries declined in 1986/87, as requirments fell in many countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. In a summary of its World Agriculture Report, the department said grain production in sub-Saharan Africa was a record high in 1986, with gains in almost every country. However, food needs in Central America rose, worsened by drought-reduced crops and civil strife. Record wheat production in 1986/87 is pushing global wheat consumption for food to a new high, and higher yielding varieties have been particularly effective where spring wheat is a common crop, it said. However, may developing countries in tropical climates, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central America, are not well adapted for wheat production, and improved varieties are not the answer to rising food needs, the department said. World per capita consumption of vegetable oil will rise in 1986/87 for the third straight year. Soybean oil constitutes almost 30 pct of vegetable oil consumption, while palm oil is the most traded, the department said."
u.s. sugar program cut sent to congress by usda,sugar grain corn,"The U.S. Agriculture Department formally transmitted to Congress a long-awaited proposal to drastically slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growers for the cut with targeted income payments. In a letter to the Congressional leadership accompanying the ""Sugar Program Improvements Act of 1987"", Peter Myers, Deputy Agriculture Secretary, said the Reagan administration wants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginning with the 1987 crop, down from 18 cts now. Sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by the government for the price support cut with targeted income payments over the four years 1988 to 1991. The payments would cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs, Myers said. The administration sugar proposal is expected to be introduced in the House of Representatives next week by Rep. John Porter, R-Ill. Congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic it is unlikely to be adopted in either the House or Senate because politically-influential sugar and corn growers and high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist. The direct payment plan outlined by the administration targets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and gradually lowers payments over four years. It also excludes from payment any output exceeding 20,000 short tons raw sugar per grower. For example, on the first 350 tons of production, a grower would receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988, 4.5 cts in 1989, 3 cts in 1990 and 1.5 cts in 1991. The income payments would be based on the amount of commercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985 or 1986 crop years, whichever is less, USDA said. Myers said the administration is proposing drastic changes in the sugar program because the current high price support is causing adverse trends in the sugar industry. He said the current program has artificially stimulated domestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowed corn sweeteners to make market inroads. U.S. sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a ""progressive contraction"" of the sugar import quota to only one mln short tons this year, he said. This has hurt cane sugar refiners who rely on imported sugar processing. Furthermore, USDA said the current sugar program gives overseas manufacturers of sugar-containing products a competitive advantage. The result has been higher imports of sugar-containing products and a flight of U.S. processing facilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar. USDA also said the current program imposes a heavy cost on U.S. consumers and industrial users. In fiscal 1987, USDA said consumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more than necessary for sugar. ""Enactment of this bill will reduce the price gap between sweeteners and help to correct or stabilize the many adverse impacts and trends which the sugar industry is currently facing,"" Myers said. The following table lists the rate of payments, in cts per lb, to growers and the quantity covered, in short tons recoverable raw sugar, under the administration's proposal to compensate sugar growers with targeted payments.

little effect seen from cold storage report,livestock pork-belly,"The USDA monthly cold storage report for meats is expected to have little, if any, effect on livestock and meat futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Monday and daily fundamentals will likely provide the bulk of direction, livestock analysts said. The increase of 66.4 mln lbs in total poultry offsets the 22.6 mln lbs decline in total red meats. Fundamentals may provide most of the direction in futures on Monday, they said. ""I think the market is going to be looking at some other things and accentuate whatever the action of cash markets might be early next week,"" Jerry Gidel, livestock analyst for GH Miller, said. Shearson Lehman livestock analyst Chuck Levitt said futures will be in the shadow of a little larger seasonal hog marketings pace next week. Also, Easter ham business was completed this week and there may be less aggressive interest for pork in general next week. ""We needed some help from the cold storage report to avert a possible setback next week in the pork complex,"" Levitt said. Analysts agreed with CME floor traders and called the belly figure neutral to slightly negative. Although belly stocks were down 33 pct from last year, they exceeded the average expectation and actually showed a lighter than expected decline from last month due to an adjustment to last month's holdings, they said. However, analysts noted that the amount of bellies put in storage has been light since the beginning of March and this is a potentially bullish situation. Glenn Grimes, agronomist at the University of Missouri, said, ""I would not look for (belly) storage during the next month or two to be heavier than a year ago - I think it will be less."""
"strike threat, lower traffic mar seaway opening",ship grain,"The St. Lawrence Seaway, set to reopen March 31 after the winter, faces another tough year because of depressed traffic levels and the possibility of the first strike in 20 years on the Great Lakes, seaway officials said. Depressed grain exports, rising costs, and competing modes of transportation are all expected to result in only a marginal increase over last year's traffic levels -- and revenues -- on the 2,300 mile waterway, officials said. In 1986, a season that ran from April 3 to December 27, the seaway moved 37.6 mln metric tons of freight between Montreal and Lake Ontario and 41.6 mln tons on the Welland Canal, linking Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. By comparison, in 1985 about 37 mln tons of cargo traveled through the Montreal-Lake Ontario section and 42 mln through the eight-lock canal. The waterway is expected to lose 9-10 mln Canadian dlrs this year, about the same as the estimated deficit for fiscal 1986-87 ending March 31, said William Blair, an executive member of Canada's St Lawrence Seaway Authority. The seaway moves about one-half of Canada's exported grain. Those exports of the single most important commodity carried on the waterway have been depressed by world surpluses. The Seafarers' International Union, which represents about 2,300 workers on the Great Lakes and the ocean coasts, has said it will likely go on strike this spring to protest employers' demands for wage rollbacks and other concessions. ""It's 99.9 pct (certain)--I guarantee you a strike,"" Roman Gralewicz, head of the Seafarers' Canadian branch, has said. The Canadian government has called in a labor conciliator to try to hammer out a contract agreement between the two sides. The seaway authority said a walkout tying up ships on the Great Lakes would badly hurt traffic. ""We haven't had a strike on the seaway for years...a prolonged strike would have a disasterous effect,"" Seaway Authority spokeswoman Gay Hemsley said. ""These are the heaviest contract talks in the history of the St Lawrence Seaway,"" George Miller, vice-president of the Canadian Lake Carriers Association, an association of major Canadian shipping companies, said recently. The workers' current contract expires May 31. The association said it is asking for a five per cent cut in wages for the next three years, reduced crew levels and the power to restructure crew dispatching. The association said its members recorded about a 6 mln dlrs (U.S.) loss in each of 1985 and 1986 due to lower traffic and freight rates and increasing competition. The seaway said 1985 was its worst year in two decades. Hemsley said the seaway authority plans to raise tolls on the Welland Canal by eight pct this year, compared to last year's 15 pct rise, while maintaining a freeze on tolls throughout the rest of the waterway. Canada is responsible for 13 of the seaway's 15 locks and about 85 pct of its revenues and maintenance costs. ""We may see and hope for a steady upward climb...but we won't see a major increase for a number of years,"" Hemsley said. A Canada-U.S. delegation to promote the seaway to shippers in Western Europe should result in some increased traffic this season but the full benefits won't be felt for several years, Blair said."
natural gas seen recapturing some market share,crude nat-gas fuel,"Higher crude oil prices will raise demand for natural gas, helping it to reclaim market share lost to heavy oil when prices plunged in 1986, analysts said. The analysts said that these efforts will be most successful in the industrial sectors of the economy with large and growing energy requirements. ""Natural gas stands a good chance to recapture the share of oil supplied to electric utilities that it lost to the residual fuel industry last year,"" Michael Smolinski, an energy economist with Data Resources Inc, told Reuters. An estimated 200,000 barrels per day of residual fuel went into the utilities market at the expense of natural gas last year when world oil prices plunged, Smolinski said. Assuming oil prices hold above 15 dlrs a barrel, national average gas prices delivered to the utilities at a projected 2.10 to 2.25 dlrs per mln Btu would be very competitive, Michael German, vice president of economic analysis at American Gas Association said. The average delivered prices at the end of January were 2.10 dlrs per mln Btu, compared with 3.26 dlrs a year ago. ""We expect natural gas to regain 250 to 400 billion cubic feet (of demand) in the overall energy market in the second and third quarter (1987),"" he said. In addition to price competitiveness, availability will be an important factor persuading energy users to switch to gas, Frank Spadine, senior energy economist with Bankers Trust Corp. in New York noted. Spadine said the mild winter in many parts of the North American continent has led to a build up of gas inventories and less would be necessary to replenish underground storage this spring freeing gas for spot sales. These forecasts develop a strong counterpoint to the fears that natural gas suplies would be tight and prices significantly higher given a sharp decline in drilling last year. AGA's German contended that despite the drilling decline, much of U.S. proved reserves could be brought to production quickly through developments such as the infill drilling which permits more wells to be drilled in proved reserve basins. Citing recent EIA statistics, German said, the gas surplus was likely to contract from three trillion cubic feet in 1986 to two trillion cubic feet in 1987, but the surplus would not go away until 1990. Smolinski of Data Resources agreed that the surplus would persist until 1990. While gas supplies may tighten in certain consuming areas, notably in California and in the Northeast U.S., an overall shortfall appeared remote."
baker denies dollar target exists,dlr money-fx,"U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker again said the meeting of six major industrial nations in Paris last month did not establish a target exchange rate for the dollar. Baker said in a television interview aired here yesterday: ""We don't have a target for the dollar."" He declined to comment on what might be a desired level for the dollar, saying: ""We really don't talk about the dollar."" He said protectionism was becoming ""extremely strong"" in the U.S. In response to widening U.S. Trade deficits and import barriers in other countries. ""The mood in the United States is extremely disturbing. It's extremely strong,"" he said. ""As I've said before, we sort of see ourselves as engaged here in a real struggle to preserve the world's free trading system, because if the largest market in the world (the U.S.) goes protectionist we run the risk of moving down the same path that the world did in the late 1930s,"" he said. While relative exchange rates had a role to play in defusing the threat of protectionism, it alone did not offer any solution, he said. ""You must address this problem on the exchange rate side, but it cannot be solved on the exchange rate side alone. It's far more comprehensive and broad than that, and the solution of it requires a comprehensive approach,"" Baker said in the interview. Baker said it would be necessary for other countries to adjust their currencies upwards, as well as remove their barriers to U.S. Imports. But he did not elaborate or name any countries."

Santos said the bid values TMOC at 248.5 mln dlrs. It said it already holds 1.91 mln of TMOC's 25 cent par shares. TMOC held interests outside the Cooper Basin region of South Australia and Queensland and the acquisition would further the Santos objective of developing as a broadly based oil and gas company with interests outside its existing base in the Cooper Basin, the company said in a statement. Santos said TMOC holds several important domestic oil and gas production, exploration and pipeline interests. In the Northern Territory it has a 43.75 pct stake in and operates the Mereenie oil and gas field in the Amadeus Basin and owns 32 pct of <N.T. Gas Pty Ltd>, owner and operator of the Alice Springs to Darwin gas pipeline. In Queensland, TMOC has extensive interests in the Surat Basin, including the 100 pct owned and operated Moonie oil field and 33 pct of the Boxleigh gas field. TMOC owns 80 pct of the <Moonie Pipeline Co Pty Ltd> which owns and operates the Moonie to Brisbane oil pipeline. TMOC also holds 25 pct of the Jackson to Moonie oil pipeline, 20 pct owned by Santos. Output from the Naccowlah block, 40 pct owned by Santos, provides the bulk of the throughput of both pipelines. TMOC has exploration interests in a number of areas in the Amadeus, Surat, Eromanga and Canning basins. It also has oil and gas interests in Britain's North Sea, Ecuador, and the U.S., Along with gold and base metal production through its associate <Paringa Mining and Exploration Co Plc>, Santos said."

It said in a report that because of an economic recovery and higher foreign exchange reserves, the Malaysian ringgit is unlikely to face devaluation in the near future. The report was presented at a two-day investment conference organised by the DBS, one of Singapore's four major banks. The report said rising commodity prices and the continued expansion of the manufacturing sector coupled with rigorous fiscal restraints and a more stable currency are grounds for cautious optimism about the Malaysian economy. It forecast the ringgit will remain stable at between 2.60 and 2.70 Malaysian dlrs to the U.S. Dollar for the rest of the year. But the report said the growth rate of Malaysia's external debt remains worrying and should be controlled. It said Malaysia's external debt totals 48 to 49 billion Malaysian dlrs and its debt service ratio exceeds 20 pct."

Taiwan's imports of U.S. Farm produce last year amounted to 1.41 billion dlrs against 1.52 billion in 1985. Imports from Europe rose to 182 mln U.S. Dlrs from 148 mln, the official said. He attributed the decline in the value of U.S. Imports to falling agricultural products prices last year."
gatt meeting hears plea for african debt relief,interest gnp trade,"Debt among African countries will continue to grow and their economies remain stifled unless developed countries lower their interest rates, Nigerian Trade Minister Samaila Mamman said. He told an informal General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting the widening gap between developed and developing countries and an inequitable international economic system were major impediments to growth in developing countries. Delegates from 23 countries are attending the GATT talks in the New Zealand resort of Taupo. ""I wish to emphasise that the growth in the volume of the external indebtedness of African countries reflects the full effect of the deflationary monetary and trade policies of the developed market economy countries,"" Mamman said. ""The developed market economy countries have slowed down output growth thereby drying up markets for the commodity exports of African countries."" Mamman said the World Bank estimated 35.3 billion dlrs a year would be needed over the next five years for the African continent to be able to achieve a gross domestic product growth (GDP) rate of three to four pct by 1990. Yet at the same time Africa's debt service was estimated at 24.5 billion dlrs a year between 1986 and 1990. ""With the best of intentions Africa cannot attain a three to four pct GDP growth rate if the current high level of debt persists,"" Mamman said. Developed countries must seek alternatives to policies that resulted in the transfer of resources and more indebtedness, he said. ""The international community cannot fail to respond positively to the collapse of the international market for commodities ... And act quickly to stabilize demand and prices of our commodity exports,"" he added."

The Research Institute on National Economy said in a report the economy will start picking up in the April-June quarter, partly because of an improvement in earnings performance and capital spending in manufacturing industries. The institute assumed an average exchange rate in the year starting April 1 of 150 yen to the dollar. It predicted the Bank of Japan will not change the official discount rate in the year. The institute forecast that Japan's exports will gradually rise in the year in volume terms as the dollar's fall in the past 18 months is likely to help prop up the U.S. Economy. Japan's trade surplus is expected to narrow slightly to 90.2 billion dlrs in 1987/88 ending March 31 from an estimated 98 billion in the current fiscal year, it said."
philippines criticises ec for vegetable oil levy,trade veg-oil,"Philippines Trade and Industry Secretary Jose Concepcion told world trade ministers he wondered if their agreement was of any real value after the European Community (EC) imposed a levy on vegetable oils. Concepcion, speaking at an informal meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) here, said ministers declared in Uruguay last September that the trade of less-developed nations should not be disrupted. He said the EC not only ignored Manila's request for lower tariffs on coconut oil but introduced a levy on vegetable oils and fats that are vital exports for Southeast Asian countries. Concepcion said while the levy might be rejected by the EC Council of Ministers, he noted that ""I cannot help but wonder whether the agreements we produce in meetings like this are of any real value."" He also said industrialised nations saved about 65 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1985 through low commodity prices, but this had affected the ability of developing nations to import goods and services. ""The health and the growth of world trade requires that the new development of developing countries losing their share of world trade be arrested and reversed,"" he said."

Western diplomats in Rangoon estimate the figure at above 70 pct and say the country can no longer depend on foreign exchange reserves to cover more than a few weeks' imports. The CPI, which oversees government spending, said in its latest report to parliament that foreign currency reserves fell to a record low of 407.9 mln kyats in September 1986 from 430.3 mln in March 1986. Earlier figures were not available. Debt servicing cost Burma 1.62 billion kyats in 1985-1986 while foreign exchange earnings -- export revenues plus loans and aid -- totalled 3.23 billion kyats in the same period, the council said. Later figures were not available. Burma, which diplomats here say now has foreign debts of up to 3.4 billion dlrs, has applied to the United Nations to be reclassified as one of the world's least developed countries in order to qualify for softer loan and grant aid."

"deng sets limit to china grain imports, paper says",grain corn rice,"China's top leader Deng Xiaoping said China must not import more than 10 mln tonnes of grain, Ming Pao newspaper of Hong Kong said. Customs figures show that China imported 7.73 mln tonnes of grain in 1986, up from 5.97 mln in 1985 but down from a record 16.15 mln in 1982. The newspaper quoted Deng as saying that grain output is one of several key issues that will influence the whole development of the economy. It did not give the context of his remarks. The 1987 grain production target is 405 mln, up from 391 mln in 1986. The newspaper quoted Deng as saying that the situation has reached the point where ""pigs are not fed, there is not enough grain and increases in output have slowed."" ""We should in our overall economic planning put agriculture in its proper place to reach our target of 480 mln tonnes by the year 2000,"" he said. ""We must avoid the situation in recent years of importing more than 10 mln tonnes of grain."" The paper quoted Deng as saying that the State Council has decided to raise the price of five grains, including corn and rice, unchanged since 1978, but it gave no details."
bangladesh forecasts gdp growth of 4.4 pct,gnp cpi reserves grain,"Gross domestic product is expected to grow by 4.4 pct in the year ending June 30, Finance Minister Mohammad Syeduzzaman told reporters. Inflation fell to an estimated 12 pct this fiscal year from 17 pct in 1981/82, he said last night. The World Bank and other independent sources have said inflation would be around 15 pct in 1986/87. Syeduzzaman said remittances from expatriates would rise to 600 mln dlrs this year from 425 mln in 1981/82. Foreign exchange reserves at end-June are projected at 680 mln dlrs compared with 105 mln in 1981/82, he said. Syeduzzaman said the export target has been set at 900 mln dlrs this year against 626 mln in 1981/82. Commitments for foreign loans and grants total more than five billion dlrs in 1986/87, against 3.54 billion five years previously, he said. The government's liberal industrial policy has attracted investment commitments totalling 250 mln dlrs, he said Foodgrain output is estimated at 16.4 mln tonnes this year, up from 16.12 mln in 1985/86 and 14.4 mln in 1981/82. Government officials have said Bangladesh must import nearly two mln tonnes of grain annually up to 1990, when the government expects to attain self-sufficiency in food."
beghin-say increases capital to finance expansion,acq grain corn,"French sugar group Beghin-Say, which is 49.6 pct owned by Italy's Gruppo Ferruzzi, is to raise its capital to 703 mln francs from 527 mln through a three-for-one issue of shares and investment certificates to finance expansion, president Jean-Marc Vernes told analysts. For the first stage Beghin-Say will issue some 2.05 mln new 65 franc shares at 500 francs to increase capital to 660 mln francs. The share currently trades at 734 francs. Then 658,000 new 65 franc investment certificates will be issued at 400 francs, raising capital to 703 mln francs. The capital increase will bring the group around 1.2 billion francs in new funds to finance its expansion plans. These include the possible acquisition of the Corn Products maize starch plant at Haubourdin in northern France, Vernes said. Ferruzzi is one of several groups bidding to buy all of Corn Products' installations in Europe. Apart from the French plant, these include three factories in each of Italy and West Germany, two in Britain and Spain and one in the Netherlands and Denmark. Corn Products has put a 650 mln dlr price tag on the installations, and Beghin-Say estimates that acquisition of the Haubourdin plant would cost between 80 and 100 mln dlrs, Vernes said. If this bid fails, Beghin-Say would consider acquiring and developing two other French plants, either in the maize or wheat starch sector. Beghin-Say is also planning to finance European expansion for its Kaysersberg subsidiary, another major reason for its capital increase. Kaysersberg, which was transformed from a division of Beghin-Say into a fully-fledged chemical subsidiary last year, has been holding talks with other European companies on possible accords, Vernes said. He added the company could be introduced onto the Paris Bourse in the near future."
bank of france says no money market tender today,money-fx interest,"The Bank of France will not hold a money market intervention tender today, ruling out a further cut in its 7-3/4 pct intervention rate, central bank sources said. At the tenders, depending on market conditions, the Bank injects liquidity into the market by buying up first category paper. But market sources said that while the recent franc performance leaves room for a further quarter point cut in the intervention rate there was plenty of market liquidity. The Bank cut its rate to 7-3/4 pct from eight pct on March 9, the first change since January 2. Interest rates also fell the same week in Britain, Belgium and Italy."
french gdp should rise 2.3 pct in 1988 - ministry,gnp trade jobs retail,"French gross domestic product should grow by 2.3 pct in 1988 after two pct growth this year and 2.1 pct in 1986, the Finance Ministry said. The latest forecast, prepared by the National Accounts and Budget Commission, assumed an exchange rate of 6.20 francs to the dollar this year and next and an average oil import price rising to 18.9 dlrs a barrel next year from 17.4 dlrs this year and 14.7 in 1986. The Commission, headed by Finance minister Edouard Balladur, forecast a fall in consumer price inflation to two pct year-on-year at end-1988 from 2.4 pct at end 1987 and 2.1 pct last year. In annual average terms inflation would fall to two pct in 1988 from 2.5 pct this year and 2.7 pct last year, it said. Trade should show a one billion franc annual surplus this year and next after last year's 0.5 billion surplus, it added. Employment should rise by 0.1 pct a year over the next two years while the state budget deficit should be cut to 2.2 pct of GDP in 1988 from 2.6 pct this year and 2.9 pct in 1986. Other forecasts prepared by the Commission indicated a 1.8 pct 1988 rise in household purchasing power, up from 1.1 pct this year but less than last year's 2.9 pct, and a 1.6 pct rise in household consumption, compared with this year's 1.5 pct and last year's 2.9 pct. Business investment is forecast to rise four pct a year this year and next after 3.7 pct last year, with private sector productive investment rising 4.9 pct in 1988 after a six pct rise this year and 5.5 pct in 1986. The Ministry said updated forecasts would be prepared before the autumn to serve as the basis for the 1988 budget, which the government is now preparing for presentation in September."

"australian wheat area to fall, forecaster says",grain wheat,"Australian wheat plantings are forecast to fall to 10.40 mln hectares in 1987/88 from 11.72 mln sown in 1986/87, Australian Wheat Forecasters Pty Ltd (AWF) said in its first preliminary crop forecast. But there was no reason to expect Australian production in 1987/88 would be less than the 16.5 mln tonnes of last year, the private forecaster said, as crops in New South Wales and Queensland suffered from poor yields last season. Most of the fall in plantings was expected in Western Australia while state average yields would be assisted by growers sowing wheat on fallows and rest paddocks, it said. The main reason for a low Western Australia estimate was a poor profit outlook under cost, credit and yield pressures. But in the eastern states the wheat area should hold up provided that rainfall between now and June is not less than average, AWF said. Although some farmers were saying they intended to cut back wheat area by 20 pct, AWF said this was unlikely since they needed cash flow and there were problems with alternative crops. ""The lack of statutory marketing for oilseeds, pulses and oats is a cause for concern if those crops are to comprise a high proportion of growers' income,"" AWF said. AWF's state area forecasts in mln hectares, with 1986/87 production in mln tonnes, are as follows (crop forecasts were not given for the new wheat year) Area Crop 1987/88 1986/87 1986/87 Queensland 0.82 0.82 0.95 N.S.W. 3.07 3.17 4.40 Victoria 1.53 1.63 3.25 S.Australia 1.45 1.64 2.30 W.Australia 3.53 4.46 5.60"

iran says it intends no threat to gulf shipping,crude ship,"Iran said reports that it intended to threaten shipping in the Gulf were baseless, and warned the U.S. And other countries not to interfere in the region. Tehran radio, monitored by the BBC, quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying any attempt at interference would be met by ""a strong response from Iran and other Moslems in the world."" U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger, in remarks apparently unrelated to the broadcast, said the U.S. Would do whatever was necessary to keep shipping lanes open in the face of new Iranian anti-ship missiles in the Gulf. The U.S. State Department said two days ago Tehran had been told of U.S. Concern that Iranian anti-ship missiles posed a threat to the free flow of oil from the Gulf. U.S. Officials have said Iran has new Chinese-made anti-ship ""Silkworm"" missiles, which pose a greater threat to merchant ships than missiles used before. The Iranian spokesman said the reports that Iran intended to attack ships were ""misleading propaganda."" He said Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was the main cause of tension in the Gulf and said Iran would continue to use ""all its legitimate means to stem the cause of tension."" Weinberger said in a television interview in the U.S. ""We are fully prepared to do what's necessary to keep the shipping going and keep the freedom of navigation available in that very vital waterway."" ""We aren't going into any disclosures or discussions of what might happen, but we are certainly very sympathetic to and listening carefully to any suggestions for our assistance in keeping navigation free in that area,"" he said. Weinberger said U.S warship movements in the Gulf area were not unusual. A U.S. Navy battle group led by the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk is currently in the northern Arabian Sea. The Iranian spokesman was quoted by Tehran radio as saying the U.S. Was trying to build up its military presence in the region."
baker denies dollar target exists,money-fx dlr trade,"U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker again said the meeting of six major industrial nations in Paris last month did not establish a target exchange rate for the dollar. Baker said in a television interview aired here yesterday: ""We don't have a target for the dollar."" He declined to comment on what might be a desired level for the dollar, saying: ""We really don't talk about the dollar."" He said protectionism was becoming ""extremely strong"" in the U.S. In response to widening U.S. Trade deficits and import barriers in other countries. ""The mood in the United States is extremely disturbing. It's extremely strong,"" he said. ""As I've said before, we sort of see ourselves as engaged here in a real struggle to preserve the world's free trading system, because if the largest market in the world (the U.S.) goes protectionist we run the risk of moving down the same path that the world did in the late 1930s,"" he said. While relative exchange rates had a role to play in defusing the threat of protectionism, it alone did not offer any solution, he said. ""You must address this problem on the exchange rate side, but it cannot be solved on the exchange rate side alone. It's far more comprehensive and broad than that, and the solution of it requires a comprehensive approach,"" Baker said in the interview. Baker said it would be necessary for other countries to adjust their currencies upwards, as well as remove their barriers to U.S. Imports. But he did not elaborate or name any countries."

cash crisis hits ugandan coffee board,coffee ship,"Uganda's state-run Coffee Marketing Board (CMB) has been suffering a cash crisis for the past two months due to a bottleneck in export shipments and administrative delays in handling payments, trade sources said. The CMB needs between 10 and 15 billion shillings (the equivalent of seven to 10 mln dlrs) to pay farmers and processors for coffee already delivered, but its present export revenue is insufficient to cover such expenditure, they said. The board's cash crisis has serious implications for the economy as a whole, since coffee accounts for 95 pct of Uganda's total exports. The CMB's financial difficulties first started in January following delays in rail-freighting export consignments of coffee to the ports of Mombasa, Dar es Salaam and Tanga. These delays were caused by a shortage of railway wagons in Uganda and bottlenecks on the ferries which transport Ugandan wagons across Lake Victoria to link up with the Kenyan and Tanzanian railway systems, the sources said Marketing Minister John Sebaana-Kizito publicly acknowledged on February 19 that the CMB had run up arrears to local suppliers as a result of the shortage of transport for moving exports. Sebaana-Kizito said at the time that the payments squeeze would be resolved in two weeks. However, an accident to the rail ferry which plies between the Ugandan lake port of Jinja and Kisumu in Kenya put it out of action between February 21 and March 15, causing fresh delays in cargo movements. Coffee exports are especially sensitive to the disruption of rail transport since president Yoweri Museveni has banned their haulage by road in a drive to save transport costs. Transport difficulties meant that by early February the CMB was holding unsold coffee stocks of around 750,000 bags. These stocks were equivalent to one quarter of Uganda's expected three mln 60-kilo bag 1986/87 (October-September) crop, the sources said. According to the sources, the board's financial problems have been aggravated by long delays in processing export receipts. The coffee board was taking about eight weeks to recycle export receipts into payments to local producers, whereas export bills handled by local banks took half that time to process, they said. The sources said the CMB's price structure had been overtaken by Uganda's high inflation rate, unofficially estimated at about 200 pct, and that this was a further disincentive to producers, already owed large arrears. ""The coffee pricing structure is wrong and three months behind, the foreign exchange rate is unrealistic, and the sooner the so-called economic package is put in top gear, the better for the coffee industry and the economy as a whole,"" one of the sources said. The government is currently negotiating a package of economic reforms with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund aimed at underpinning a renewed inflow of foreign aid to help Uganda's economic recovery after 15 years of political strife."
world dependency on mideast oil said inevitable,crude nat-gas,"The world's dependency on the Mideast as the source for its petroleum is growing and nothing is going to stop it, Donald K. McIvor, an Exxon Corp <XON> Director and senior vice president told Reuters in an interview. ""Non-OPEC production will begin to decline and the gap between demand and supply will widen so that the trend to increasing dependence on OPEC and the Middle East is inevitable,"" McIvor said. Decreased supplies will firm prices for crude oil but are not likely to change a growing dependence, McIvor said. McIvor, Exxon's senior vice president responsible for oil and gas exploration and production said that dependence would result from the Mideast's large spare capacity at a time when the rest of the world consumes more oil than it was finding. ""Since 1970 we've been consuming oil at rates of 20-25 billion barrels per year while making new discoveries of only about 10-15 bilion barrels per year,"" McIvor said. ""The bulk of the inventory and more than half of the remaining proved reserves lies in the middle east which is producing at much less than current capacity,"" he added. McIvor said that of the some 30,000 oil fields discovered so far only 37 ""one-one thousandth of the total number contained about 35 pct of all the oil ever discovered."" McIvor said, in response to a question, that he did not believe there were any more ""super giants"", or oil fields with reserves greater than five billion barrels, to be found which would change the conclusion of the world's growing dependency. ""Of those 37 super giants only 11 lie outside the Middle East. Only five of the 37 have been discovered in the past 20 years and only two of these lie outside the middle east (Cantarell in Mexico and Alaska's North Slope)."" McIvor said. McIvor said that many of the large fields outside the U.S. like Alaska's Prudhoe Bay and the North Sea were reaching a peak and would soon begin to decline. But the Exxon executive said that there were still plenty of opportunities to be explored and developed outside of the Middle east, particulartly in Canada, the North Sea, and Australia and Africa. McIvor said that decisions to explore and drill in those areas would be depedent upon both the expectations of a higher price of oil as well as the legal regime affecting the companies. ""The ideal regime is a stable one not one where there is a constant change in policies,"" McIvor said. McIvor said he opposed import subsidies or tariffs used to increase exploration as these only benefit one part of the economy at the expense of other parts of the economy. Asked about the options offered this week by U.S. Energy Secretary Herrington to increase U.S. production McIvor said he could not comment on subjects like the oil depletion allowance now but ""the thrust of his (Herrington) report is valid. It has highlighted the growing dependency on the Middle east and the need to increase U.S. production."" McIvor also said that he expected natural gas to play a greater role in the future in meeting energy needs. ""Natural gas will have the opportunity to become an increasingly important part of the worlkd's energy supply,"" McIvor said. ""Crude oil will be used more and more as a transportation fuel and natural gas will be used more to generate heat, as an industrial fuel,"" he added."

Toepfer said in its latest report. It is too soon to assess the extent of the damage, but it is likely that northern West German crops are particularly at risk because of insufficient snow cover, it said. The soil needs to warm up rapidly and moisture content must improve to avoid further delays to spring field work, it added."

The central bank bought bank bills outright comprising 345 mln stg in band one at 9-7/8 pct and 75 mln stg in band two at 9-3/16 pct. It also purchased 65 mln stg of treasury bills in band one at 9-7/8 pct.
rains promise bountiful crops in ethiopia,grain corn barley,"Rain over wide areas has raised the prospect of good food crops throughout Ethiopia, which suffered a disastrous drought and famine two years ago. Aweke Aynalem, head of the government's Agriculture Development Department, told reporters prospects were good for attaining the target of 250,000 tonnes of grain in the present growing season, one of two each year in Ethiopia. Normal crop production in Ethiopia is about 648,000 tonnes a year, of which 250,000 tonnes are produced from the ""belg"" (small) rains which fall at this time of year. The belg rains are used to plant quick-maturing crops like maize and barley. Any shortfall during this period affects production in the main rainy season, because farmers eat their stocks of seed. Aweke said peasants in Wello, Tigre and Hararghe -- regions which suffered severely from drought -- were now able to sow their crops because of the favourable rains. The government had distributed large quantities of seed and fertiliser, and the rains should ensure a good crop."
market loan could be pinned to u.s. trade bill,trade cotton grain corn wheat oilseed,"Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., said he was considering amending the Senate Finance Committee's trade bill with a provision to require a marketing loan for soybeans, corn and wheat. Pryor told the Futures Industry Association that there was great reluctance among members of the Senate Agriculture Committee to reopen the 1985 farm bill, and that a marketing loan might have a better chance in the Finance panel. The Arkansas senator said the marketing loan -- which in effect allows producers to pay back their crop loans at the world price -- had led to a 300 pct increase in U.S. cotton exports in 14 months and a 72 pct increase in rice exports. Pryor serves on both the Senate Finance and Agriculture Committees."

The balance comprised 25,000 tonnes of grains plus oilseeds and 45,000 tonnes of derivatives. This week's estimated arrivals total 487,000 tonnes, of which 107,000 are grains/oilseeds and 380,000 derivatives. The figures cover around 95 pct of Rotterdam traffic in the products concerned."
portuguese grain agency ban opposed by minister,grain corn,"Portugal's Agriculture Minister Alvaro Barreto said he disagreed with a court order barring the state grain buying agency EPAC from taking part in cereals import tenders open to private traders. Barreto told reporters his aim was to have EPAC readmitted to the tenders. Under the terms of Portugal's January 1986 accession to the European Community (EC), a grain import monopoly held by EPAC (Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais) is being reduced by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990. Following legal proceedings by private importers, Lisbon's civil court decided in a preliminary ruling earlier this month that EPAC should not be allowed to take part, as it had done, in tenders for the liberalised share of annual grain imports. As a result of this ruling, EPAC was excluded from a March 12 tender for the import of 80,000 tonnes of maize. Barreto said, ""My objective is put EPAC into the tenders because it has a right to take part."" He added the government would be studying the court order to see whether or not the ruling could stop EPAC from participating in future tenders. Barreto said there was no reason to exclude any operator, whether public or private, from the tenders. Private traders had argued that EPAC, given its dominant position in the Portuguese grain market, had an unfair advantage over them. ""There is no reason to make EPAC a martyr of the system,"" Barreto said. He said the EC's executive commission had accepted the government's view that EPAC should be eligible. The Lisbon court ruling stated that EPAC's participation in the public tenders was unfair competition and violated the clauses of Portugal's EC accession treaty dealing with the gradual dismantling of the state agency's import monopoly."
u.s. farm policy debate could hit senate soon,grain wheat cotton rice,"The Senate this week might take up proposed legislation that could serve as a lightning rod to expose broad initiatives to change U.S. farm policy. The Senate could consider a House-passed bill that would allow wheat and feedgrains farmers to receive at least 92 pct of their income support payments if flooding last year prevented, or will prevent, them from planting their 1987 crops, Senate staff members told Reuters. Also pending is a bill extend the life of the National Commission on Dairy Policy. Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., intends to offer an amendment to one of the bills that would suspend the minimum planting requirement for all 1987 wheat, feedgrain, cotton and rice producers, an aide said. Under current law, producers must plant at least 50 pct of their base acreage to be eligible for 92 pct of their deficiency payments. Most major U.S. farm groups have lobbied hard against making any fundamental changes in the 1985 farm bill out of fear a full-scale debate could expose agricultural problems to budget-cutting pressures. Representatives of these farm groups have said they also fear efforts by Midwestern Democrats to force a floor vote on a bill that would require large acreage set-asides in return for sharply higher support prices. However, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, sponsor of the bill, told Reuters he did not intend to offer his measure as a floor amendment but to bring it through the committee."
u.s. prepared to escort kuwaiti tankers,crude ship,"The United States has offered Navy warships to escort Kuwaiti oil tankers into and out of the Gulf where they could be threatened by new Iranian anti-ship missiles, U.S. defense officials said today. ""We believe the Kuwaitis have also approached the Soviet Union about the possibility of using Soviet tankers"" to ship their oil, one of the officials told Reuters. ""But if there is superpower protection, we would rather it come from us,"" the official said. The officials, who asked not to be identified, said Kuwait had asked about possible protection for a dozen vessels, most of them oil tankers, which could be supplied by three U.S. Navy guided missile destroyers and two guided missile frigates now in the southern part of the Gulf. ""We told them we would give them help and we are waiting to hear the Kuwaiti response to our offer,"" one official said. In addition to a half dozen ships in the U.S. Navy's small Mideast Task Force near the Straits of Hormuz, the Pentagon has moved 18 warships -- including the Aircraft Carrier Kitty Hawk -- into the northern Indian Ocean in the past month. White House and defense officials said today that massing of the fleet was routine and had nothing to do with the Iran-Iraq war or Iran's recent stationing of Chinese-made anti-ship missiles near the mouth of the Gulf. The land-based missiles have increased concern in Kuwait and other Middle East countries that their oil shipments might be affected. Several hundred vessels have been confirmed hit in the Gulf by Iran and Iraq since early 1984. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters today that it was in the U.S. strategic interest to keep the free flow of oil in the gulf and through the Straits of Hormuz. But he said U.S. ships in the region were on routine maneuvers. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger on Sunday declined to discuss specifics, but said the United States would do whatever was necessary to keep the Gulf shipping open in the face of new Iranian anti-ship missiles in the region. ""We are fully prepared to do what's necessary to keep the shipping going and keep the freedom of navigation available in that very vital waterway of the world,"" he said on NBC television's ""Meet the Press."" The State Department said Friday Iran has been informed about U.S. concern over the threat to oil shipments in the Gulf. The communciation was sent through Switzerland, which represents American interests in Iran. Iran on Sunday denied as baseless reports that it intended to threaten shipping in the gulf and warned the United States that any interference in the region would meet a strong response from Tehran, Tehran Radio said. An Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, quoted in a broadcast monitored by the BBC in London, said reports that Iran intends to threaten shipping in the Gulf were baseless. ""In conjunction with this misleading propaganda, America has already paved the ground to achieve its expansionist and hegemonistic intentions, aiming to build up its military presence in the region,"" he was quoted as saying."
"iraq reports attacks on supertanker, oil targets",crude ship,"Iraq said today its warplnes had attacked a supertanker and four Iranian oil sites and vowed to keep up such raids until the Gulf war ends. The surprise escalation of attacks on oil installations broke more than a month-long lull in Iraqi air force action. It also followed celebrations yesterday of what Baghdad hailed as Iran's failure to achieve victory during the Iranian year which ended on Saturday. A high command communique said warplanes hit the western jetty at Iran's Kharg island oil terminal in the afternoon and struck a supertanker nearby at the same time. The Kharg terminal, attacked about 135 times since August 1985, was last raided in January. The communique did not identify the supertanker, but said columns of smoke were seen billowing from it. In London, Lloyds insurance said the 162,046-ton Iranian tanker Avaj was hit on Saturday, when Iraq reported an earlier Gulf attack. But there has been no independent confirmation of today's supertanker attack nor of other raids on shipping reported by Baghdad in the past 24 hours. The last confirmed Iraqi attack took place on March eight, when the Iranian tanker Khark-5 was hit south of Kharg. Iraqi warplanes also struck Iran's offshore oilfields at Nowruz, Cyrus and Ardeshir in northern gulf, some 80 km (50 miles) west of Kharg island, today's communique said. The three oilfields have been raided several times in the past three years. Oil sources said they were not crucially important to Iran's oil export trade. A second high command communique today said Iraqi warplanes flew 94 sorties against Iranan targets and positions at the war front. It also reported a clash between Iraqi naval units and several Iranian boats carrying men to attack an Iraqi oil terminal at the northen tip of the Gulf.

Under the accord, reached following U.S. complaints about the impact on its agricultural exports of Spanish EC membership, the EC will import two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum a year up to end of 1990. All this produce will be imported into Spain at special levy levels likely to be below those applying for imports into other EC countries. The sources said it was possible that the Spanish intervention board would be asked to buy the produce directly this year, as it was rather late to make other arrangements. They added that the choice for future years appears to lie between a system of regular tenders and the setting of a daily special levy applicable to Spanish imports. There will initially be no tax on re-exports of maize and sorghum from Spain to other EC countries, although such a tax could be imposed later, the sources added."
"iraq reports attacks on supertanker, oil targets",ship crude,"Iraq said its warplanes had attacked a supertanker and four Iranian oil sites and vowed to keep up such raids until the Gulf war ends. The surprise escalation of attacks on oil installations broke more than a month-long lull in Iraqi air force action. It also followed celebrations yesterday of what Baghdad hailed as Iran's failure to achieve victory during the Iranian year which ended on Saturday. A high command communique said warplanes hit the western jetty at Iran's Kharg island oil terminal in the afternoon and struck a supertanker nearby at the same time. The Kharg terminal, attacked about 135 times since August 1985, was last raided in January. The communique did not identify the supertanker, but said columns of smoke were seen billowing from it. In London, Lloyds insurance said the 162,046-ton Iranian tanker Avaj was hit on Saturday, when Iraq reported an earlier Gulf attack. But there has been no independent confirmation of today's supertanker attack nor of other raids on shipping reported by Baghdad in the past 24 hours. The last confirmed Iraqi attack took place on March 8, when the Iranian tanker Khark-5 was hit south of Kharg. Iraqi warplanes also struck Iran's offshore oilfields at Nowruz, Cyrus and Ardeshir in northern gulf, some 80 km (50 miles) west of Kharg island, today's communique said."
1987 u.s. soybean loan should stay same-amstutz,oilseed soybean,"Congress should give the U.S. Agriculture Secretary the authority to keep the 1987 soybean loan rate at the current effective rate of 4.56 dlrs per bushel in order to help resolve the problem of soybean export competitiveness, USDA undersecretary Dan Amstutz said. Speaking to reporters following a Senate Agriculture Appropriations hearing, Amstutz suggested that one way out of the current soybean program ""dilemma"" would be for Congress to allow the loan rate to remain at 4.56 dlrs. He indicated if the loan rate were 4.56 dlrs, USDA could then consider ways to make U.S. soybeans more competitive such as using certificates to further buydown the loan rate. Under current law, the 1987 soybean loan rate cannot be less than 4.77 dlrs per bu. Amstutz' suggestion would be for Congress to change the farm bill to allow USDA to leave the soybean loan rate at 4.56 dlrs in crop year 1987 rather than increase it to 4.77 dlrs. The 1986 effective loan rate is 4.56 dlrs because of the 4.3 pct Gramm-Rudman budget cut. Amstutz stressed that a major factor in any decision on soybean program changes will be the budget costs. He told the hearing that the problem in soybeans is that the U.S. loan rate provides an ""umbrella"" to foreign production and causes competitive problems for U.S. soybeans. Asked about the American Soybean Association's request for some form of income support, Amstutz said ""the competitive problem is the most severe."" He said USDA is still studying the situation and ""no resolution"" has yet been found."
u.s. willing to talk to moscow on wheat price,grain wheat corn,"U.S. Agriculture undersecretary Dan Amstutz indicated the United States is willing talk with the Soviet Union about the competitiveness of U.S. wheat prices but would not discuss making U.S. wheat prices ""cheap."" ""There sometimes is a difference between being competitive and being cheap,"" Amstutz told a Senate Agriculture Appropriations hearing. Amstutz said the difference of opinion between Moscow and Washington last summer on the level of the U.S. subsidy offered on wheat to the Soviet Union, was over whether the U.S. wheat price was competitive or cheap. ""I think there is a (U.S.) willingness to explore this issue as it pertains to competitiveness,"" Amstutz said. However, Amstutz added that the United States would not be willing to discuss wheat prices with Moscow ""if the issue is being cheap."" Asked later by a reporter what he meant by the distinction between competitive and cheap, Amstutz would not elaborate. Amstutz said it is the U.S. judgment that the long-term grain agreement between the two countries calls for Moscow to buy at least four mln tonnes each of wheat and corn annually at ""prices in effect in this country."" Amstutz made the comments in response to a question from Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, about expanding the export enhancement program to include grain sales to the Soviet Union."
american express <axp> approves shearson offer,acq earn,"American Express Co said its board approved a public offering of about 18 pct of its wholly owned Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc brokerage unit. American Express also approved the previously announced plan to sell about 13 pct, or 13 mln convertible preferred, of the unit to Nippon Life insurance co for 538 mln dlrs. The preferred shares are convertible to the same number of common shares following Hart-Scott-Rodino and FDIC approvals. American Express said it will maintain 60 pct, or 60 mln of the 100 mln shares of Shearson that will be outstanding. American Express said it had agreed with Nippon life that American Express will hold a minimum of 40 pct of Shearson until January, 1999. American Express said 7.5 mln Shearson shares would be held by certain employees of Shearson and one mln by a Shearson stock ownership plan to be formed. American Express said it anticipates a registration statement for the public offering will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission shortly. American Express also declared a two-for-one stock split and raised its quarterly dividend to 38 cts per share from 36 cts on a pre-split basis. Both dividends are payable May 8, to shareholders of record April 3. There are currently 215 mln American Express shares outstanding. The transaction with Nippon Life remains subject to approval by the Japanese ministry of finance, which is expected in April. American Express also said an agreement was reached by Shearson and Nippon Life providing for a joint venture in London. The venture will focus on investment advisory asset management, market research and consulting on financing. It also said it expects the relationship to extend to selected projects involving American Express, Shearson Lehman and Nippon Life in key financial centers of Asia and other regions, and to future personnel exchanges. Under the agreement, Nippon will receive 13 mln cumulative preferred shares with a five pct dividend rate. The cumulative preferred stock will become convertible with voting powers to an equal number of common shares following the U.S. government approvals. American Express said that assuming conversion of the preferred stock held by Nippon, 100 mln shares of Shearson Lehman common stock would be outstanding. For the public offering, it said there will be an underwriters overallotment option to purchase 1.8 mln shares. American Express will also grant Nippon Life a five-year warrant to purchase one mln American Express common shares at 100 dlrs per share. There are currently 215 mln American Express shares outstanding. Nippon Life would be entitled to nominate two directors to the Shearson board and one representative to serve as an adviser to the American Express board of directors. ""These proposed transactions are yet another signal that american express intends to stay in the forefront of the financial services industry worldwide,"" said American Express Chairman James D. Robinson. ""The implementation of our plans, moreover, will enable us to maintain a majority interest in shearson while enhancing the strength of our balance sheet by tapping additional capital resources for shearson outside american express.""

They said the bank seemed more determined to support the dollar than it did this morning. Several dealers said the central bank intervened this afternoon when the dollar stood around 149 yen.

(corrected) - philippines criticises ec for oil levy,trade veg-oil coconut-oil,"Philippines Trade and Industry Secretary Jose Concepcion told world trade ministers he wondered if their agreement was of any real value after the European Community (EC) proposed a levy on vegetable oils. Concepcion, speaking at an informal meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) here, said ministers declared in Uruguay last September that the trade of less-developed nations should not be disrupted. He said the EC not only ignored Manila's request for lower tariffs on coconut oil but proposed a levy on vegetable oils and fats that are vital exports for Southeast Asian countries. Concepcion said while the levy might be rejected by the EC Council of Ministers, he noted that ""I cannot help but wonder whether the agreements we produce in meetings like this are of any real value."" He also said industrialised nations saved about 65 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1985 through low commodity prices, but this had affected the ability of developing nations to import goods and services. ""The health and the growth of world trade requires that the new development of developing countries losing their share of world trade be arrested and reversed,"" he said."
taiwan complains about size of reserves,reserves trade money-fx,"Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves, swollen by strong trade surpluses to a record 53 billion U.S. Dlrs, are becoming a problem, government officials said. Official figures show the latest level compares with the previous record of 51 billion dlrs on March 4 and about 26 billion in late March 1986. Central bank Governor Chang Chi-cheng told reporters the increase in reserves was the result of heavy intervention by the bank on the local interbank market. It bought nearly two billion U.S. Dlrs between March 5 and 23, he said. Wang Chao-ming, vice chairman of the government's Council for Economic Planning and Development, told Reuters the rising reserves were ""a big headache for Taiwan."" He said the government expects heavier pressure from the U.S., Where protectionist bills are being proposed against nations such as Taiwan and Japan with large trade surpluses with the U.S. Wang said the government would launch new measures within the next two months to further reduce import tariffs and open the market wider to foreign products, especially those from the U.S. Wang said the measures aim at helping reduce Taiwan's trade surplus, which rose to 2.73 billion U.S. Dlrs in the first two months of 1987 from 2.02 billion a year earlier. Nearly 90 pct of the surplus was with the U.S. Vice Economic Minister Wang Chien-shien agreed with Wang's remarks and said efforts to avert U.S. Protectionism were running out of time. ""We must do it quickly or face retaliation from Washington,"" he said. He said the measures would include removal of trade barriers on insurance and inland services for U.S. Companies. Chang Chi-cheng said the central bank could not stop buying U.S. Dollars because of heavy sales by local exporters who fear the strong local dollar will cause them exchange losses. He said the bank is studying revision of the foreign exchange rules in hope of further reducing currency controls, but declined to give details. The Taiwan dollar has risen about 15 pct against the U.S. Dollar since September 1985. It opened at 34.38 to the U.S. Dollar today and is expected to rise further to 33 in June and to 32 by end-year, some foreign bankers said."
shell australia reports 45.79 mln dlr 1986 profit,earn crude,"Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD.AMS> unit <Shell Australia Ltd>, said its net profit fell to 45.79 mln dlrs in 1986 from 66.76 mln in 1985. Revenue fell to 4.55 billion dlrs from 4.91 billion, in an extremely competitive and over-regulated environment, chairman and chief executive Kevan Gosper said in a statement. A 26.25 mln dlr annual dividend would be paid to the parent after a very disappointing year. ""A return of 2.2 pct on funds employed represents a very meagre return ... In an economy suffering from inflation of around 10 pct,"" he said. Gosper said the results reflected heavy reliance on downstream oil and chemicals, poor coal and metal returns and the financial burden of the North-West Shelf gas project. Duties, royalties and taxes rose to 1.37 billion dlrs against 852.72 mln in 1985 and Gosper urged the government to move quickly to lift costly and unnecessary regulation. ""It is just as important for Australia to maintain a financially healthy, technically advanced refining and marketing industry as it is to sustain oil exploration and production,"" he said. ""The Australian oil industry has the experience and the capacity to serve the nation and its shareholders well if the government would stop putting roadblocks in our way,"" he said. Shell invested 500 mln dlrs over the past five years to upgrade its oil refining and marketing business, but further investment required an appropriate rate of return, he said. Exploration and evaluation spending in 1986 fell to 18.77 mln dlrs from 26.35 mln, while investment in property and plant rose to 374.25 mln from 353.94 mln a year earlier. Gosper said oil companies would be under intense pressure in 1987 because of forecast slow economic growth."
"u.k., australia offer wheat to bangladesh",grain wheat,"Britain and Australia have offered a total of 129,250 tonnes of wheat to Bangladesh as grants to contain rising cereal prices and help support rural employment projects, officials said. They said 79,250 tonnes of wheat promised by Britain would be shipped next week and used for the government's ""Food for Work"" program in the villages. Under the program, workers building roads, digging irrigation canals and engaged in other rural development activities get their daily wages in wheat instead of money. The 50,000 tonnes of Australian wheat would arrive in Bangladesh next month and be sold under open-market operations designed to stop price increases, the officials said. Prices of rice and wheat have risen at least 15 pct in the past month, market sources said. But the government expects prices to fall after the wheat harvest next month."
doubts about accord seen weakening dollar further,money-fx dlr,"The dollar is expected to decline further in coming days as scepticism mounts about the effectiveness of last month's Paris accord to stabilise currency exchange rates, senior foreign exchange dealers said. Following its fall today to a record 148.40 yen, dealers said they expect the dollar to establish a new trading range of 147 to 150 yen before the market again tries to push it down. Behind the latest dollar fall lies the belief that last month's accord was no longer enough to stop operators pushing the dollar down, the dealers said. ""The recent remark by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that the Paris accord did not set any target ranges for major currencies has cast a shadow on the agreement,"" said Koji Kidokoro, general manager of Mitsui Bank Ltd's treasury division. He said the market interpreted this as indicating the U.S. Would favour a weaker dollar and it had little intention of intervening to support the currency. ""This eliminated the widespread market caution against possible joint central bank intervention,"" Kidokoro said. Dealers said the dollar had gathered renewed downward momentum and that Bank of Japan intervention alone could hardly contain a further slide in the currency. They said the central bank bought between one to 1.5 billion dlrs today, including direct purchases through brokers, and yesterday it might have bought a small amount of dollars through the U.S. Central bank in New York. Most dealers said they doubted the U.S. Federal Reserve would intervene on its own account to support the dollar, but some said this might occur if the dollar fell much below 148 yen. ""If the dollar drops to that low level, it could reduce the flow of foreign capital into U.S. Securities, which the Americans don't want,"" said Haruya Uehara, chief money market manager of Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp. He said the dollar may return to around 152 yen next month when corporations reduce their dollar sales after they close their books for the 1986/87 business year ending on March 31. But dealers said the longer-term outlook for the dollar remained bearish. This was due to the lacklustre performance of the U.S. Economy, the continuing U.S. Trade deficit and Japanese delays in announcing an economic stimulation package. ""The Americans are getting frustrated at Japan's inertia in stimulating its economy,"" said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant general manager of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd's international treasury division. In the Paris currency accord Japan promised a package of economic measures, after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed, to boost domestic demand, increase imports, and thus reduce its trade surplus. The package was expected in April, but debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of parliamentary business over the proposed introduction of a sales tax. In the circumstances the government had only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future, Dai-Ichi Kangyo's Tanaka said. Dealers said if steps are not taken to stimulate the Japanese economy protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress would grow and put more downward pressure on the dollar."
santos says profits hit by oil price fall,earn crude nat-gas,"Leading Australian onshore oil and gas producer, Santos Ltd <STOS.S>, said its 1986 results were hit by sharp reductions in prices for crude oil, condensate and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The Cooper Basin producer earlier reported a fall in net profit to 88.67 mln dlrs from 144.04 mln in 1985. Santos chairman Sir Brian Massy-Greene said in a statement that increased production, particularly of oil and LPG, along with reduced operating costs and reduced or deferred oil exploration and development outlays, were helping Santos deal with an adverse business climate. Santos said it remained financially strong with an injection of 84 mln dlrs from the second instalment of a 1985 rights issue, and had cash reserves of 381.3 mln dlrs at the end of 1986 against 401.9 mln a year earlier. It said it had also made significant progress in repaying debts and at year end the ratio of debt to shareholders' funds had fallen to 1.01 from 1.54. Santos yesterday announced a 4.00 dlr a share takeover bid for the 96.93 pct it did not already hold in oil and gas company <TMOC Resources Ltd> -- valuing the target at 248.5 mln dlrs. Santos said 75 pct of its loans were U.S. Dollar denominated and significant currency purchases were made during the year to maintain that natural hedge. At year end it held 145 mln U.S. Dlrs, enough to meet all 1987 repayments. Santos said it had a successful gas exploration program, finding 172 billion cubic feet in South Australia, but oil exploration was less successful with 1.62 mln barrels added to reserves -- less than depletion during the year. Cooper Basin producers are committed to a two-year scheme to double gas exploration while Santos said its 1987 budget for oil exploration had been boosted 20 pct. Santos said the outlook for 1987 depended on prices and production volumes but with extra oil exploration and encouraging gas finds there were grounds for optimism. But it called on the goverment to continue fostering domestic producers through the Import Parity Price scheme. ""It makes no sense to abandon this policy now when exploration is at its lowest level for many years and when Australia's oil self-sufficency is expected to decline rapidly,"" Massy-Green said."

japan economy may start bottoming out soon -agency,ipi trade,"Japan's economy remains sluggish but is beginning to show signs it may bottom out soon, the Economic Planning Agency said in a monthly report submitted to Cabinet ministers. But a bottoming out of the economy depends largely on the yen's exchange rate trend in the immediate future, Agency officials said. The officials told reporters industrial production, down 0.5 pct in January from December, is likely to turn positive in February and to rise thereafter, raising hopes for a brighter economic outlook. The Agency predicted industrial production will grow 2.5 pct in the current January/March quarter after falling 0.7 pct in the previous quarter. A rise of this size would be the largest since the fourth quarter of 1984 when industrial output rose 2.7 pct, the officials said. They also said an expected upturn in exports would be a mixed blessing as it would contribute to economic growth but would increase the chance of trade friction. Japanese exports contracted five pct in February from January but are likely to grow from March if the yen stabilizes around current levels, the officials said. They predicted exports will increase by 2.3 pct in the January/March quarter from the October/December quarter. ""But the problem is imports are not expanding,"" said one official. Imports fell by 9.4 pct in February from January."
u.s. offers to escort kuwaiti tankers in gulf,crude ship,"The U.S. Has offered warships to escort Kuwaiti tankers in the Gulf past Iranian anti-ship missile batteries, Defence Department officials said. The officials told Reuters yesterday the offer was made last week by Navy Admiral William Crowe, chairman of the Pentagon Joint Chiefs of Staff, during a Middle East visit. Reagan administration officials said later that Washington did not seek military confrontation with Tehran, but would not let Iran use Chinese-made ""Silkworm"" anti-ship missiles, capable of covering the narrow entrance to the Gulf, to choke oil shipments to the West. Defence officials said Kuwait had asked if protection for up to a dozen vessels, most of them tankers, could be provided by three U.S. Navy destroyers and two frigates now in the southern Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. In addition to a half dozen ships in the U.S. Navy's small Mideast Task Force near the Straits of Hormuz, the Pentagon has moved 18 warships, including the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk, into the northern Arabian Sea in the past month. White House and defence officials said that massing the fleet was routine and had nothing to do with the Iran-Iraq war or Iran's stationing of missiles near the mouth of the Gulf. The State Department said on Friday that Iran has been told about U.S. Concern over the threat to oil shipments in the Gulf. The communication was sent through Switzerland, which represents U.S. Interests in Iran. Iran denied as baseless reports that it intended to threaten shipping in the Gulf and said any U.S. Interference in the region would meet a strong response, Tehran Radio said on Sunday. Several hundred vessels have been confirmed hit in the Gulf by Iran and Iraq since early 1984 in the so-called tanker war, an offshoot of their 6-1/2-year-old ground conflict."

dollar drop seen as test of paris agreement,money-fx dlr,"The sharp drop in the value of the dollar against the yen and the mark is the first serious test of last month's Group of Five (G-5) plus Canada agreement to stabilise currencies, dealers and bank economists said. ""The dollar will be pushed down until there is coordinated central bank intervention,"" one dealer for a German bank said, echoing widepread sentiment in the market. But opinion was divided on whether the united front forged in Paris still exists. Some dealers said there were growing signs the United States wanted the dollar to fall further. Despite repeated Bank of Japan intervention, the dollar plunged to a post-war low in Tokyo today. It was quoted as low as 148.40 yen in the Far East and dealers here said they expected the U.S. Currency to decline further. ""The dollar is now firmly within a broad 140 to 150 yen range,"" Chase Bank AG's senior dealer Eckhart Hager said. Others said there were technical reasons for the sharp dollar drop. ""Window-dressing"" operations by some Japanese companies who were selling dollars and buying yen before the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31 were undermining the U.S. Currency. Dealers said main reason for the sell-off was not technical. U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's comment the Paris accord did not have fixed dollar targets was seen as a renewed attempt by the U.S. Administration to talk the dollar down. ""Suddenly, support levels which had existed for fear of central bank intervention disappeared,"" one dealer said. The Bank of Japan was believed to have bought some 1.5 billion dlrs, and this with comments by Japanese officials indicated Tokyo was unhappy about the plunge, dealers said. Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita threatened central bank intervention if necessary. Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said today the time had come for the six nations who agreed in Paris last month to stabilise currencies - Japan, Britain, Canada, France, the U.S. And West Germany - to take action in line with the pact. But the Bundesbank and other European central banks were not detected in the open market during the European morning. Opinion here was divided on when the Bundesbank would act. While some said the West German central bank would support the dollar once it fell below 1.80 marks, others said the Bundesbank would only intervene after a fall below 1.75 marks or if the decline accelerated. The Bundesbank last intervened on January 27, when the dollar threatened to fall below 1.81 marks. ""The Japanese seem to be on their own at the moment,"" one dealer said. Others said cooperation between central banks and governments was easier said than done. Some said Baker's remarks and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter's warning that the U.S. And Japan were on the verge of a serious trade conflict showed there was a rift. ""It's hard to tell whether the G-6 agreement still stands,"" a dealer said. Another added, ""If the Americans do not get what they want, they will push the dollar down, regardless of G-6."" Citibank AG also cast doubt on the chances of success for the Paris agreement in its latest investment letter. ""It is hard to see that Japan and Germany are willing or able to loosen fiscal policy sufficiently to offset the necessary U.S. Fiscal contraction,"" Citibank said. It added, ""Markets should therefore be aware that 1.80 marks is not the lower limit for the dollar -- a rate of 1.70 marks or even less is expected this year."" And London Broker Hoare Govett said in its March 1987 economic report, ""We are looking for a further, more gradual, fall, possibly to 1.60 marks by the end of the year."" But opinion about whether the Paris accord was still in force was not universal. Some dealers said not too much should be read into Baker's and Yeutter's comments. ""There is no reason to believe the Paris pact has broken down,"" a senior dealer said."
spain raises call money rates on higher demand,money-fx interest money-supply,"The Bank of Spain raised overnight call money rates by 1/4 to 14 pct on demand for 746 billion pesetas in today's auction, which a bank spokesman termed ""heavy."" Rates stood at 12.1 pct at the start of the year and have been increased to drain liquidity on rising demands for funds, the spokesman said. He said in reply to Reuters inquiries that rates could rise further if money supply growth rose above this year's eight pct target for M-4, defined as liquid assets in public hands. Money supply rose at an annualised rate of 16.7 pct last month against 8.1 pct in January. Growth was 11.4 pct in 1986. A leading Spanish broker said the central bank was applying a more restrictive policy to keep the lid on inflation. The consumer price index rose 8.3 pct last year. ""Money supply control is the government's chief weapon against inflation,"" he said. ""The problem is higher rates are attracting liquidity from abroad."" He said this was why the central bank enacted specific measures to control the inflow of foreign capital. The Bank of Spain earlier this month imposed a 19 pct reserve requirement on new convertible peseta funds held by banks to curb short-term speculative capital from abroad."

They said the intervention occurred near the dollar's early low of 148.50 yen and the U.S. currency subsequently firmed to 149.05/15. It closed at 150.00/05 on Monday. Dealers were uncertain of the amount involved and whether the Fed's purchases were for its own account or for a customer. But there was speculation that it may have been done in conjunction with the Bank of Japan. Tokyo dealers said the Japanese central bank bought dollars in Tokyo earlier today."

u.s. economy shows promising signs of growth,retail jobs gnp inventories trade cpi,"The U.S. economy is showing some promising signs of accelerated expansion despite the sluggishness of the fourth quarter last year, private economists say. Some of the slowness experienced in the October-December period had been expected to spill over into the first quarter this year, as the tax law changes that went into effect in January slowed business and consumer spending. But some of the latest economic data show signs of surprising strength in the U.S. economy, although some economists remain cautious about the outlook. The Commerce Department reported today that new orders for durable goods in February jumped by 5.7 billion dlrs, a six pct rise, to 101.2 billion dlrs. Even excluding volatile defense goods, durable goods orders rose a healthy 3.8 pct, the agency said. The February numbers surpassed the expectations of many financial analysts, whose predictions ranged from flat to increases of up to five pct. The January/February employment statistics suggest the Gross National Product will show a healthy rate of growth for the first three months of this year, said Lyle Gramley, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association. The U.S. jobless rate in February and January was 6.7 pct, the lowest rate since March 1980. The number of new non-farm jobs rose by 337,000 in February after a 319,000 gain in January and a 225,000 December increase, the government said. The employment data suggests a GNP annual growth rate of about three to 3.25 pct in the first quarter, said Gramley. Much of that will be attributed to businesses rebuilding their inventories and is not likely to be sustained in the second quarter, Gramley said. He expects a slowdown in the second quarter with smaller increases in personal consumption and government spending. He also sees residential construction declining mostly for multi-family housing units. Fidelity Bank senior economist Mickey Levy said some of the fourth quarter slowness will continue. Levy predicts GNP will grow at a scant 1.5 pct rate in the first quarter of 1987, accelerate during the second quarter and show a brisk 4.5 pct annual rate in the third quarter. The key to both forecasts is a marked improvement in the U.S. trade balance which is expected because of the decline in the dollar's value over the last year and half. ""The improvement will be gradual and long lasting,"" Levy predicted. Most of it will be through import reduction, but at least one-third will be due to a rise in product exports as the prices of U.S. goods become more attractive overseas. The Reagan administration has predicted the trade deficit, which soared to record levels last year, will improve this year and the U.S. economy will grow by a respectable 3.2 pct for the year compared with a 2.5 pct rate last year. As part of the effort to reduce the trade deficit, the U.S. has been pressing West Germany and Japan to stimulate their domestic demand for goods from the U.S. and others. U.S. officials believe that would help take some of the pressure off the United States whose five years of economic growth has been the mainstay of developing countries. The U.S. economy provided them with a giant market for their goods giving them a way to earn income badly needed to service their foreign debt. The government last week said the U.S. economy grew at a modest 1.1 pct annual rate during the fourth quarter. There were indications of improvement in the huge imbalance between the volume of goods imported to the United States and those shipped abroad. The report showed a rising volume of exports corresponding to a decline in imports despite the fact that in current dollar terms, the U.S. trade deficit worsened during the closing three months of 1986. While fourth quarter economic growth was weak, corporate profits jumped a healthy 6.1 pct during the period, the government said. It also reported that inflation, as measured by the GNP price deflator, remained in check, growing a moderate 0.7 pct in the period, the lowest rise in 19 years. The government also reported that consumer spending, a key element of the five year economic recovery, jumped 1.7 pct in February, after falling two pct in January. The Federal Reserve Board also reported that the manufacturing sector, which had been one of the weaker elements of the U.S. economy, was showing signs of recovery. In its latest report on current economic conditions, the Fed said that economic activity in the various regions of the country ranged from uneven or steady to improving. Manufacturing activity showed signs of improvement in most regions except Dallas where orders remained sluggish. Chase Econometrics Chairman Lawrence Chimerine said the pick up in the U.S. manufacturing sector is largely due to the drop in the dollar's value. He said he does not foresee a major pick up in economic activity, but does not believe the economy will slip into recession either. He said higher prices on imported products and wage cuts that have helped the manufacturing sector will squeeze consumers purchasing power. ""That pattern is starting and will continue for a number of years,"" Chimerine said. He sees economic growth hovering around a modest two pct level for the next few years."
iran warns u.s. not to intervene in the gulf,ship crude,"The speaker of the Iranian Parliament, Hojatoleslam Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, warned the U.S. Not to intervene in the Gulf, a day after Washington said its warships were available to escort Kuwaiti tankers through the waterway. ""If U.S. Intervention occurs, the entire world will become insecure for the Americans and the events of Lebanon could be repeated for the Americans everywhere,"" he said. U.S. Defence officials disclosed in Washington yesterday that the U.S. Navy, which has about 24 warships in or near the Gulf, was prepared to escort Kuwaiti tankers, regular targets for Iranian attacks in an offshoot of its war with Iraq. Rafsanjani, in an interview reported by the Iranian news agency IRNA, also commented on earlier U.S. Disclosures that Iran had erected sites for new Chinese-made Silkworm anti-shipping missiles at the Strait of Hormuz. The agency, received in London, quoted him as saying that Iran did not need missiles to close the strait, 24 miles wide at its narrowest, because ""we can close it with artillery only."" He added ""We have the longest coasts and the highest interest here and the small southern (Gulf) states have a lesser interest compared with us and therefore it is natural for us to protect the security of the Strait of Hormuz more than others."""

USDA said government outlays to rice farmers in 1987 are expected to reach 403 dlrs per acre planted, followed by corn at 135 dlrs per planted acre. Government outlays include mainly deficiency payments and price support loans. On a per acre basis, cotton payments will reach 73.24 dlrs in 1987, wheat 60.30 dlrs, sorghum 54.38 dlrs, barley 27.41 dlrs and oats 2.31 dlrs, USDA said. USDA estimates farm subsidies will reach 25.3 billion dlrs in 1987. The figures were given by USDA officials at a Senate Agriculture Appropriations hearing yesterday."

ec cold aid food scheme may be made permanent,grain sugar carcass livestock,"Emergency action to distribute European Community (EC) food surpluses to the poor has proved so successful that the EC executive Commission may propose a permanent scheme, a Commission spokesman said. Almost 60,000 tonnes of food was taken out of EC stores between January 20, when Agriculture Ministers approved the scheme, and March 13, according to latest commission figures. The food, including 30,000 tonnes of cereals, 6,000 tonnes of sugar, 4,000 tonnes of beef and 13,300 tonnes of butter, has been distributed to the needy through charities. The present scheme was approved as an emergency measure to help poor people affected by this year's unusually cold winter and will end on March 31. But the spokesman said the commission will consider whether to propose it be replaced by an all-year-round system. The commission estimates that up to March 13 the temporary scheme cost between 63 and 68 mln European currency units (72/78 mln dlrs). This is above the 50 mln Ecu (57 mln dlr) ceiling originally envisaged by the Ministers. However, commission sources said the real cost was small if account is taken of the expense of keeping food in store until its quality and value deteriorates. On the other hand, the impact of the temporary scheme on EC food surpluses has been slight. EC surplus food stocks at January 31 included 1.28 mln tonnes of butter, 520,000 tonnes of beef and over 10 mln tonnes of cereals."
u.s. court allows offshore alaskan exploration,crude nat-gas,"A unanimous Supreme Court ruled that oil and gas exploration can proceed on two tracts off the Alaska coast which were leased by the federal government to eight major oil companies. The ruling was an important victory for the oil companies and the Reagan administration's controversial off-shore leasing program and a setback for two small Alaskan villages that challenged the leases by claiming damage to the environment. The administration said that the court-ordered halt in drilling had created uncertainty over the 4.2 billion dlrs paid for 621 leases off the shores of Alaska since December 1980. A federal appeals court ordered the oil companies to halt all exploration and remove all drilling rigs from two tracts in the Bering Sea off Alaska because of possible harm to the subsistence needs and culture of native Eskimos. But the Supreme Court said the appeals court was wrong in issuing an injunction halting exploration. ""Here, injury to subsistence resources from exploration was not at all probable,"" Justice Byron White wrote for the court. ""And on the other side of the balance of harms was the fact that the oil companies had committed approximately 70 mln dlrs to exploration to be conducted during the summer of 1985 which they would have lost without chance of recovery had exploration been enjoined,"" he said. The oil companies, Amoco Corp <AN>, ARCO, Exxon Corp <XON>, Mobil Corp <MOB>, Sohio, Shell, Texaco Inc <TX> and Union Oil, had said that voiding previously granted leases would result in staggering financial losses. The first lease sale in 1983 involved 2.4 mln acres and generated 318 mln dlrs while the second lease sale in 1984 covered 37 mln acres and produced 516 mln dlrs. Administration officials, saying the lease sales were preceded by an intense environmental impact study, denied that the oil and gas exploration would hurt subsistence resources. The Alaskan villages of Gambell and Stebbins, along with an organization of Eskimo natives on the Yukon Delta, argued that the drilling would hurt native hunting and fishing."
lower tax offsets lower shell u.k. upstream profit,earn crude nat-gas,"<Shell U.K. Ltd's> pre-tax profit on exploration and production operations fell to 869 mln stg in 1986 from 2.12 billion in 1985 due to the fall in oil prices last year, Shell U.K. Finance director Nigel Haslam said. But he told a press conference that due to the high marginal tax rate on North Sea operations, the main impact of the drop in profit was absorbed by a fall in taxation to 330 mln stg from 1.45 billion in 1985. The bulk of tax last year was Corporation Tax, with Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) representing only 16 mln stg, he said. As a result, post-tax profit from the exploration and production sector fell by only 126 mln stg to 539 mln. Earlier, Shell U.K., a subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD.AS>, reported an overall net profit of 757 mln stg, up from 667 mln in 1985, on sales of 6.57 billion stg against 8.81 mln. Shell U.K. Chairman Bob Reid said the company's crude oil output from the North Sea was at a record 373,000 bpd in 1986, which would almost certainly prove to be a peak for the company. Shell expects a fall in output of around 10 pct in the current year to around 340,000 bpd, due mainly to the decline in output from the major Brent field, he said. Gas output of 5.9 billion cubic metres and natural gas liquids output of around one mln tonnes in 1986 are expected to be maintained in 1987, he said. A final decision on development of the Kittiwake and Osprey North Sea oil fields will be made in the next 12 to 18 months, Reid said. The Kittiwake field, originally part of the 2.5 billion stg Gannet project abandoned last year when the oil price fell, is now estimated to cost around 350 mln stg. Economies on development costs for the Tern and Eider North Sea fields, which were approved last year, have brought the cost down to 30 to 35 pct below the original budget. Day to day operating costs of the exploration and production sector had been cut 10 pct last year, and the target is to keep costs per barrel constant. The company drilled 17 wells offshore, with 10 leading to the discovery of hydrocarbons, although it is too early to gauge the commercial viability of these discoveries, Reid said. Restructuring of the downstream oil sector contributed to a profit rise to 187 mln stg in 1986 from 91 mln stg in 1985. Jaap Klootwijk, managing director of downstream unit <Shell U.K. Oil>, said refining margins in the first quarter of 1987 were a ""bit better than the very bad fourth quarter 1986."" In November and December in particular, refining operations had shown negative margins following the fall in crude and oil product prices, he said. He expected margins to continue generally positive over the summer, although they could dip to become negative from time to time, depending on price movements. A new catalytic cracker at Shell's Stanlow refinery will now come on stream by the end of first quarter 1988, about five months behind schedule, following a crane accident which severely damaged the plant last year, he said. Profits from the chemicals sector rose to 33 mln stg from 11 mln after the rationalisation of the Carrington chemical site. Haslam said the Budget announcement on PRT relief, by which companies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying development expenditure on certain future oil fields against PRT, was ""helpful,"" but rather less than had been hoped for. Reid said his estimate of crude oil prices this year was in the range of 15 to 18 dlrs. If prices went much above that, he would expect some over-production above OPEC""s official 15.8 mln bpd output ceiling which would tend to bring prices back down. He said it looked as if the December OPEC pact to restrain output was holding, bringing supply and demand into balance, but the test will come in summer when demand for OPEC oil will fall."

It said there is significant potential for the discovery of additional ore. Hecla said initial production from a trackless underground mine is scheduled for late 1988 at a rate of about 1,000 tons or ore per day. ""At this rate, the Greens Creek mine will be the largest domestic silver mine and is expected to be one of the lowest cost producers."" The company said it estimates its total investment in the project, including its share of preproduction costs, at about 45 mln dlrs, to be funded through internally generated cash and existing lines of credit.

KUNA also said the envoy had discussed the deployment of Iranian missiles near the Strait of Hormuz with Kuwaiti Foreign Undersecretary Suliman Majed al-Shaheen. A British naval source in the Gulf said today Iran had test-fired its new Silkworm missiles and set up launching sites in the area.

drawdown seen in u.s. distillate stocks,crude gas,"Tonight's American Petroleum Institute oil inventory report is expected to show another drawdown in distillate stocks of between two and 7.5 mln barrels for the week ending March 20, oil analysts and traders said. They said they expect gasoline inventories to be depleted by about one to four mln barrels. Analysts were divided on the crude stocks. Some saw stocks unchanged to as much as three mln barrels higher. Others said stocks could be down one to five mln barrels. Crude throughput volumes are expected to be unchanged to slightly higher or lower than the week ended March 13, traders said. The API recorded a 7.4 mln barrel stockdraw for U.S. distillates in the week ended March 13. Analysts see another draw reflecting historic seasonal trends. For the week ended March 13, API reported gasoline stocks down 2.9 mln barrels. Those expecting a draw of as much as four mln barrels said they are looking for fairly high consumption rates as the spring and summer driving season gets underway this year, because retail prices are still low compared to recent years. U.S. crude oil stocks were reported down by 4.4 mln barrels for the week ended March 13. Analysts are divided over the outcome for last week because there is uncertainty about whether throughput levels increased or decreased last week. Some see crude stock levels unchanged to three mln barrels higher, while others think inventories could be as much as five mln barrels below the previous week. The lower estimates are supported by the belief that crude runs increased and imports fell. The API reported crude runs 154,000 b/d higher for the week ended March 13. Analysts are calling it unchanged to slightly up or down for the week ended March 20. Expectations for product stockdraws are already being reflected in firmer prices, traders said. But if draws are at the higher end of the estimated range, they added, the effect will be bullish. Any stockbuild would be a negative factor, they said. Crude runs normally increase in March, and any decrease in runs would be friendly to the market, said Peter Beutel of Elders Energy Futures Inc."
sterling outlook clouded by test of paris accord,money-fx stg interest,"The move by foreign exchange markets to test the strength of the Paris currency accord has thrown into question the near-term outlook for sterling, until recently one of the main beneficiaries of the agreement, analysts said. Since the six-nation accord last month, sterling has risen sharply, adding almost five pct on its trade-weighted index. While the accord effectively stifled dollar/yen and dollar/mark movements, the markets turned their attention to sterling as foreign investors rushed to take advantage of relatively high U.K. Interest rates. But analysts say the pound has been sidelined by the first tentative test of the Paris accord seen yesterday. The market now looks set sooner or later to push the dollar down further in a test of the willingness of central banks to intervene. Analysts say if the banks do not intervene effectively, the Paris accord could collapse. ""On balance, sterling would be a net sufferer if G-6 collapses,"" Phillips and Drew analyst Stephen Lewis said. He said sterling would lose out as markets turned their attention to capital movements whereas previously they had been restricted to looking only at the interest yield on currencies. However, although most analysts and foreign exchange dealers were forecasting a brief period of consolidation or even retracement for sterling, none were expecting a very sharp drop in the U.K. Currency. Sterling remained supported by optimism on the U.K. Political and economic outlook, firmer oil prices and relatively high interest rates, they said. Bullish sentiment on the U.K. Economic outlook has been running especially high after last week's budget, seen as popular both with the markets and with British voters. Sterling was also supported by signs of a weakening in the West German and Japanese economies, where growth for 1987 is trailing behind the three pct forecast for the U.K. Recent opinion polls showing Britain's ruling conservative party ahead of opposition parties in popularity have also supported the pound. In addition, sterling has so far shrugged off two half-point cuts in U.K. Bank base lending rates in less than two weeks. A further half-point cut, widely expected in the next week or so, has already been largely discounted. U.K. Base rates, now running at 10 pct, are still relatively high compared to other western countries, and analysts said a further base rate cut to 9-1/2 pct was unlikely to affect sterling. Sterling today appeared resilient to the dollar's decline, dropping only slightly on a cross-rate basis. Worries about renewed turbulence in the foreign exchange markets, however, were reflected in the U.K. Government bond (gilt) market, where prices dropped by up to 5/16 point. Until now foreign investor interest in the gilt market has been one of the major reasons behind the rise in sterling. Dealers said they expected the pound to hold quietly steady for the next few days while the market awaits further developments on the dollar and this Thursday's U.K. Current account figures for February. Market forecasts are for a deficit of around 250 mln stg after January's small surplus."
standard chartered boosted bad-debt provisions,earn ship,"Standard Chartered Plc <STCH.L>, faced with a recession in the key Singapore and Malaysian markets and an ongoing depression in the shipping industry, boosted its bad-debt provisions in 1986, chairman Lord Barber said. Barber said in a statement on the bank's 1986 results that bad and doubtful debt provisions, both general and specific, stood at 545.6 mln stg against 416.6 mln at end-1985. Bank figures showed the increase was almost exclusively in the specific bad risk provision, which qualifies for U.K. Tax breaks. New specific provisions rose by 111.5 mln stg while 71.2 mln stg were reallocated from the general risk provision. In all, a 184.2 mln stg charge was made against profits for 1986, compared with a 100.7 mln stg charge in 1985. Total pre-tax profits fell to 254 mln after 268 mln in 1985. ""The continuing serious recessionary conditions in Singapore and Malaysia and the depressed condition of the shipping industry made it necessary to provide heavily against bad and doubtful debs arising from loans in the Asia Pacific region, on top of the normal level of provisioning,"" Barber said. He said, ""the decision was also taken to build up loan loss reeserves by making a sizeable increase in the charges for general provisions for commercial and cross border risks."" Barber said due to bad-debt provisioning, the Asia Pacific region made ""a negligible contribution to pre-tax profits."" He said the profits contribution from the U.K. Businesses was ""well maintained, although the reported result was affected by cross border debt provisioning,"" while Californian subsidiary Union Bank ""showed continued growth."" ""Tropical Africa, Middle East and South Asia all turned in excellent performances and the revival in Europe continued,"" he said. Barber said the group, which succesfully fought off a takeover bid by Lloyds Bank <LLOY.L> last year, strengthened its capital resources during that year to just over three billion stg, while total assets increased to 32.2 billion. Capital adequacy ratios remained strong, with the primary capital ratio standing at 7.5 pct at end 1986, he said."

heavy signup seen in 1987 corn program - usda,grain corn,"With less than a week remaining to enroll in the 1987 feedgrains program, Agriculture Department officials said that final signup will probably exceed last year's level of 85 pct. Enrollment in USDA's basic acreage reduction program will likely total close to 90 pct, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, ASCS, officials said, with 50 to 70 pct of the enrolling farmers also expected to sign up for the paid land diversion program. The signup period of the 1987 feedgrains program officially ends at the close of the business day on March 30. USDA will release its official signup report around April 15, an official said. USDA personnel in the corn belt states of Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana have been reporting heavy signup activity, an ASCS official told Reuters. A surge of acitivity is expected during this final week of signup, the official said. ""A lot of farmers have been dragging their feet because they were anticipating some changes in the program, but that doesn't look very likely now,"" he said. To enroll in the 1987 feedgrains program, farmers have to set aside 20 pct of the program acreage base, and have the option to idle an additional 15 pct under a paid land diversion program."
"brazilian seamen say 14,000 now back at work",ship coffee,"About 14,000 of Brazil's 40,000 seamen are now back at work after pay accords with 21 shipping companies but the rest are still on strike, a spokesman at strike headquarters said today. The seamen began a national stoppage on February 27. The spokesman, talking by telephone from Rio de Janeiro, said 126 ships were strike-bound. He added that because of resignations by many seamen there were scarcely any crews left on 38 of these ships. The seamen have settled in general for pay rises of 120 pct with the 21 companies. Talks with the shipowners' association Syndarma have been deadlocked over overtime. While exports have been delayed by the strike, exporters say the problems have been manageable. ""It hasn't been critical by any means,"" said a coffee trader in Santos, who noted that coffee was still moving on foreign ships. Economic analysts added, however, that any delay to exports served to aggravate Brazil's balance of payments crisis, which last month prompted the government to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt."
calumet industries <cali> sees 2nd qtr loss,earn crude,"Calumet Industries Inc said it expects to report a loss from operations for its second quarter ending March 31, despite a strong unit sales increase. In the same year-ago period the company reported net income of 366,953 dlrs, or 18 cts a share. Chairman S. Mark Salvino said the expected loss is primarily due to depressed product prices not recovering the increasing cost of crude oil. Salvino also said steadier crude prices and the reduced rate of refinery production should increase product prices and lead to a return to more normal profit margins. He reported that the 23 mln dlr HydroCal II system under construction at the company's refinery in Princeton, La., is on schedule and production will begin early in fiscal 1988."
pdvsa income on oil sales fell 45 pct in 1986,earn crude gas,"The state oil company Petroeleos de Venezuela ended 1986 with a decrease of 45 pct in income from oil sales even though it surpassed its own export goal by almost 100,000 barrels a day, Minister of Energy and Mines Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said. Speaking to a news conference following the PDVSA annual assembly, Hernandez said PDVSA's income from oil sales had dropped to 7.2 billion dlrs in 1986, down 45 pct from last year's 13.3 billion. Fiscal revenue from oil sales, which was estimated at 66 billion bolivares for 1986, totalled 43.5 billion, a drop of 34 pct which Hernandez said ""had a very serious impact on Venezuela."" PDVSA's export volume averaged 1.508 mln barrels a day, of which 658,000 bpd were crude oil and 850,000 bpd refined products. The figure surpassed PDVSA's stated goal of 1.410 mln bpd and the 1985 export volume of 1.371 mln bpd. But it was not enough to cover the losses from a drop in the average price from 25.88 dlrs per barrel in 1985 to 13.90 dlrs last year. The 13.90 per barrel price for 1986 was 1.01 dlrs higher than the figure originally announced by the Central Bank. Hernandez said the increase had come from a new accounting system which included the results of PDVSA's overseas refining and marketing operations. Consumption in Venezuela's internal market increased from 323,000 bpd in 1985 to 342,000 bpd last year. However, Hernandez stressed that the government had managed to keep gasoline sales almost constant at 164,000 bpd. Exploration by PDVSA led to an increase of 675 mln barrels in reserves of light and medium crudes, shifting the balance of Venezuela's reserves away from heavy crude oil. The country's production capacity at year-end 1986 was 2.562 mln bpd, of which 1.420 mln are light and medium crudes, Hernandez said. Venezuela's total proven reserves as of December 31, 1986 were 55.521 billion barrels, the fourth largest amount in the world, Hernandez said."
imperial oil <imo.a> to focus on higher profit,earn crude pet-chem,"Imperial Oil Ltd, 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp <XON>, will focus on maintaining its financial strength and improving near-term earnings performance through operating expense reductions and selective capital spending, the company said in the annual report. Imperial Oil said it expects to spend about 750 mln dlrs on capital and exploration expenditures in 1987, compared to 648 mln dlrs in 1986 and 1.16 billion dlrs in 1985. Imperial previously reported 1986 operating net profit fell to 440 mln dlrs or 2.69 dlrs share from 694 mln dlrs or 4.27 dlrs share in the prior year. Imperial Oil said the attention to earnings results from the desire to pursue longer term growth opportunities should the investment climate improve and the belief that low or volatile crude oil prices could continue during the next several years. The company also said actions initiated during 1986 to restructure and improve efficiency should continue to show benefits in 1987. During 1986, the company cut operating, administrative and marketing expenses by 91 mln dlrs and reduced the number of workers by 16 pct to 12,500. Imperial chairman Arden Haynes said in the annual report that it is too early to determine whether the recent upward movement in international oil prices will be sustained. ""It is still a time for prudence and caution, and the company's actions will continue to be based on the fundamentals of market supply and demand,"" he said. Haynes said prospects for the company's petroleum products division are more promising than before, but are still uncertain. Imperial's 1986 petroleum earnings rose to 174 mln dlrs from 102 mln dlrs in 1985. Haynes said more satisfactory product margins on its petroleum products could result if demand recovers as it has in the United States. The company's chemicals business outlook is mixed, Haynes said. Prospects for growth in petrochemical sales is good as long as economic growth continues, but future large grain surpluses could dampen fertilizer demand and maintain pressure on prices. Imperial's chemical business earned 17 mln dlrs in 1986, compared to three mln dlrs in 1985."
cpc <cpc> to sell european business,acq earn,"CPC International Inc said it reached an agreement in principle to sell its European corn wet milling business to Agricola Finanziaria SpA, a member of the Ferruzzi Group, for a price in excess of 600 mln dlrs. The transaction is expected to be completed by September 30. CPC said it expects no material gain or loss this year from the transaction. But the effect of the deal on 1987 earnings can be evaluated in full only when the definitive pacts are completed, it said. The long-term effect of the transaction on CPC's earnings should be positive, it added, as it will allow capital expenditures to be cut back and will reduce corporate and divisional overheads as well as operating expenses in the European business. The sale is an important part of a restructuring announced in November, CPC said. Proceeds of the sale will be used to reduce debt incurred in the purchase of the Arnold Foods and Old London specialty baking businesses and the stock repurchase program that was part of the restructuring. As of December 31, CPC had bought about 15 mln of its common shares, adjusted for a 2-for-1 split in January, for a total cost of 621.8 mln dlrs, according to its 1986 annual report. In December, CPC acquired Arnold Foods and Old London for a total of about 170 mln dlrs. CPC had previously said it wanted to sell the European corn wet milling business and use the proceeds to help reduce debt, including that incurred under the share buyback. In total, CPC has bought back about 16 mln shares of common stock, adjusted for the split, it said today. In November it authorized a buyback of 20 mln shares, adjusted for the split. The buyback and the restructuring were triggered in November, after companies controlled by Ronald Perelman, chairman of Revlon Group Inc <REV>, acquired about 7.6 pct of CPC's then outstanding stock. In 1986, the European corn wet milling business had sales of 914.1 mln dlrs, operating income before overheads of 68.8 mln dlrs and associated headquarters overhead costs of 19.7 mln dlrs, according to CPC's 1986 annual report. The businesses' assets were 645.7 mln dlrs in 1986, the report said."

baldrige supports nic talks on currencies,trade money-fx,"Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said he supported efforts to persuade newly-industrialized countries (NICS) to revalue currencies that are tied to the dollar in order to help the United States cut its massive trade deficit. ""We do need to do something with those currencies or we will be substituting Japanese products for Taiwanese products,"" or those of other nations with currencies tied to the dollar, Baldrige told a House banking subcommittee. The U.S. dollar has declined in value against the Yen and European currencies, but has changed very little against the currencies of some developing countries such as South Korea and Taiwan because they are linked to the value of the dollar. As a result, efforts to reduce the value of the dollar over the past year and a half have done little to improve the trade deficits with those countries. Baldrige told a House Banking subcommittee that the Treasury Department was attempting to persuade those countries to reach agreement with the United States on exchange rates."

The credit terms extended for export sales under the Intermediate Export Credit Guarantee Program (GSM-103) must be in excess of three years but not more than seven years. All sales must be registered and exports completed by September 30, 1987, the department said."
dollar expected to fall despite intervention,money-fx dlr,"Central bank intervention in the foreign exchange markets succeeded in staunching the dollar's losses today, but senior dealers here believe the U.S. currency is headed for a further retreat. Although the intervention was widespread, dealers perceive that the six major industrial nations have differing levels of commitment to their recent accord to stabilize currencies. Moreover, hard economic realities hold greater sway over the currency market than central bank intervention and these argue for a further dollar decline, dealers said. ""The market can be bigger than the central banks. And economic fundamentals will always come to the fore,"" said a dealer at one major U.S. bank. As the dollar dropped to post-World War II lows against the yen today foreign exchange traders said the Bank of Japan, Federal Reserve Board and Bank of England intervened in the markets on behalf of the U.S. currency. Reports of the authorities' actions helped the dollar recover to about 149.45 yen in New York this afternoon from the post-war low of 148.20 yen in the Far East. But it still failed to regain Monday's U.S. closing level of 150.00/05 yen. Tokyo dealers said the Bank of Japan bought one to 1.5 billion dlrs in Tokyo today and may also have purchased dollars yesterday in the U.S. via the Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, there were strong rumors in New York that the Fed also bought a modest amount of dollars around 148.50 yen today. Talk also circulated that the Bank of England purchased a small amount of dollars for yen. The Fed's last confirmed intervention was on January 28 when it bought 50 mln dlrs in coordination with the Bank of Japan. But on March 11 the Fed also was rumored to have signalled displeasure with a dollar surge above 1.87 marks. The authorities' actions appeared to back up the February 22 Paris pact between the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain, France and Canada under which the nations agreed to cooperate to foster exchange rate stability around prevailing levels. But foreign exchange dealers were not overly impressed by the authorities' intervention which they said can only soften extreme moves in the market. For one thing, some dealers believed that the Fed's purchases were done on behalf of the Bank of Japan rather than for the U.S. central bank's own account, suggesting a rather watered-down American commitment to the currency accord. The Bank of England's action also was thought to be completed on behalf of the Japanese central bank, reinforcing the market's view that Japan is the most resolute of the six nations in its support of the currency pact. ""No-one doubts the Bank of Japan is serious. But the other two central banks seem to be making more token gestures than anything else,"" said Chris Bourdain of BankAmerica Corp. ""I'm not convinced the intervention was concerted,"" said Earl Johnson of Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. ""It's a yen problem more than anything else."" Some dealers said a rising wave of trade protectionist sentiment in the U.S. limits the extent to which the American authorities can endorse a stronger dollar against the yen. ""The dollar's break below the key 150 yen level ties the Treasury's hands behind its back. The U.S. cannot intervene on its own account because of the strength of protectionism here,"" said Albert Soria of Swiss Bank Corp. Such comments reflect the view that the currency markets are becoming increasingly politicized. Despite official denials, some traders still feel the U.S. would countenance a lower dollar to help trim the nation's trade deficit. The majority of the 170 billion dlr merchandise trade deficit in 1986 was with Japan. Indeed U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker's comment on Sunday that the February currency pact had not established dollar targets was read by the market as a signal to sell the U.S. currency and kicked off the latest retreat. ""The dollar still has more room on the downside against the yen based on the frictions in trade and financial services. The currency market is becoming very political,"" said Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank Ltd. Okada expects the dollar to trade between 148 and 150 yen this week but sees the chance of a drop to 140 yen by the end of April or early May. Even if West Germany and Japan succeed in stimulating their economies, it may not be enough to solve structural economic imbalances in the near future, dealers said. ""Even if Japan and West Germany do expand this year, it won't be enough to help the trade situation much,"" said Bourdain of BankAmerica, who also expects the dollar to drop to 148 yen in the next couple of days."
gencorp <gy> proposals withdrawn from meeting,earn acq,"GenCorp Inc said it withdrew from consideration at its annual meeting on March 31 proposals aimed at providing for a stock split and an increased dividend so that it could focus its energies on responding to the takeover offer made last week by a partnership of AFG Industries Inc <AFG> and Wagner and Brown. In addition to proposing an increase in the number of its outstanding common shares, GenCorp had suggested the adoption of a classified or ""staggered"" board and the elimination of cumulative voting. GenCorp said these proposals could ""distract energy and attention from the real task at hand -- to respond to the tender offer in a manner which is in the best interests of the company, its shareholders and its other constituencies."" GenCorp said the proposal to increase its outstanding shares was made with the aim of declaring a stock split and a dividend increase. The other proposals, it said, would provide for greater long-term stability and cohesiveness for the GenCorp board. The company did not indicate when it might resubmit the proposals for approval by its shareholders."
fed chairman volcker says bank proposals a worry,money-fx trade,"The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Paul Volcker, has written to the chairman of the House Banking Committee to raise concerns about legislative proposals scheduled for consideration Wednesday. Volcker told committee chairman Fernand St. Germain a proposal to deny primary dealer status to firms from countries that do not grant U.S. firms equal access to their government debt markets might invite retaliation against U.S. firms abroad. He added, ""even Japan, against whom this proposal seems to be particularly directed,"" has started opening its markets. In his letter, made available at the Treasury, Volcker also said a proposal to ease debt problems of developing countries by setting up a public facility to buy their debts owed to commercial banks, was a problem. ""I believe that the prospect of debt relief would undermine the difficult internal efforts of the borrowing countries to achieve the structural reform that is needed regardless of the policies that are followed on servicing external debt,"" Volcker said. It might also cause private lenders to become reluctant to extend more credit to the borrowing countries, he said. Volcker said he endorsed comments by Treasury Secretary James Baker ""about the inappropriateness of using public resources for purchasing private commercial bank debt, which we both see as an inherent aspect of the proposed international debt facility."" He also said a proposal for establishing formal procedures for international negotiations on currency exchange rates ""is unrealistic and could well have damaging effects."" ""For example, the bill's directive to intitiate negotiations in order to achieve a competitive exchange rate for the dollar -- a matter upon which there can be considerable difference among analysts -- runs the risk of building up potentially destabilizing market expectations,"" Volcker said. He recommended ""we should not lock ourselves into formalized procedures for international negotiations"" on exchange rates but instead use other, more flexible means like the recent mmeting in Paris between U.S. treasury and central bank representatives and those of major trade allies."
u.s. corn acreage seen near record low,grain corn oilseed soybean,"U.S. corn acreage this year is likely to drop to the lowest level since the unsurpassed acreage reductions of the 1983 PIK year and could rank as one of the lowest corn plantings in the United States in sixty years, Agriculture Department officials said. USDA releases its official plantings report on March 31. Agriculture Department analysts said next week's figures will likely show a sharp drop in acreage to as low as 65 mln acres, down 22 pct from last year's plantings of 83.3 mln acres. Assuming an 18 mln acre drop in plantings, U.S. corn production will also decrease significantly. Analysts said 1987 corn production could drop by over one billion bushels to around seven billion bushels. Expected signup of up to 90 pct in the 1987 feed grains program, along with 1.9 mln acres enrolled in the conservation program, will cause acreage to plummet, Department feedgrain analysts said. ""There's no question that there will be a sharp decrease in corn acreage,"" one said. ""It's difficult for any farmer to not go along with the program this year."" Soybean acreage is also expected to decline this year but at a much slower rate of around four pct, USDA analysts said. Soybean plantings could drop to 59 mln acres or below, they said, compared to last year's level of 61.5 mln acres. If analysts' unofficial estimates prove correct then the drop in u.s. corn acreage will be the largest since 1983 when farmers idled 22 mln acres in the Payment-In-Kind program. Farmers planted only around 60 mln acres of corn in 1983. A severe drought that summer in major producing states caused yields to tumble and final crop production to total only 4.2 billion bushels. Given normal weather conditions this year, USDA analysts said the 1987 corn crop could end up around seven billion bushels, down from last year's crop of 8.3 billion bushels. ""This kind of acreage reduction will mean a significant reduction in production,"" an analyst said. A crop of seven billion bushels is close to the annual U.S. corn usage, so surplus stocks, while not decreasing, would not increase significantly, a specialist said. High producing corn belt states are expected to show the greatest acreage reductions, based upon historical participation in government programs, analysts said. In contrast, soybean acreage is likely to be cut the most in marginal producing areas of the southeast and the western corn belt, a USDA soybean analyst said. ""Soybean acreage in the eastern corn belt will not budge,"" he said. Neither does he expect any significant acreage cuts in higher-producing delta areas. Soybean production could drop fractionally from last year's 2.0 billion bushels to 1.8 to 1.9 billion, he said. U.S. soybean acreage, after soaring to 71.4 mln acres in 1979 from only 52 mln acres five years prior to that, has steadily declined in the 1980's. U.S. corn acreage, with the exception of 1983, has been in the low to mid 80-mln acre range for the past 10 years. The highest corn plantings reported in the 60 years that USDA has kept such records was in 1932 when farmers planted 113 mln acres and obtained average yields of 26.5 bushels per acre. Last year U.S. farmers obtained record corn yields averaging 119.3 bushels per acre. ""We have absolutely no trouble producing an eight billion bushel crop on only 80 mln acres or so,"" an analyst said. Corn acreage will probably level at around 65 mln acres as long as government program provisions remain the same, analysts said. Currently farmers enrolling in the program are required to set aside 20 pct of their base acreage and then are eligible for payments of two dlrs per bushel by idling an additional 15 pct of their acreage. ""To get to the PIK level of 60 mln acres, we would have to provide more incentives,"" an analyst said."
u.s. senators seek to expand usda export bonus,trade hog carcass livestock,"Leading U.S. farm state senators are seeking to insert into the Senate's omnibus trade bill a provision that would broaden eligibility requirements under the U.S. Agriculture Department's export enhancement program, EEP, to include traditional buyers of U.S. farm products, including the Soviet Union, Senate staff said. Under existing criteria, USDA can offer EEP subsidies to recoup export markets lost to competing nations' unfair trading practices. Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) is leading a group of farm state senators in an effort to broaden the criteria in such a way as to enable Moscow to be eligible for the subsidies, sources said. The senators -- including Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), Max Baucus (D-Mont.), David Pryor (D-Ark.), John Melcher (D-Mont.) and Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) -- also may fold into the trade bill a measure to shield pork producers and processors from Canadian imports. The measure, sponsored by Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), would clarify the definition of ""industry"" in determining whether or not imports were causing injury to U.S. producers. Grassley's bill stems from a 1985 decision by the International Trade Commission that imports from Canada of live swine -- but not fresh, chilled and frozen pork -- were harming U.S. producers. The bill's proponents have argued Canada has simply replaced shipments of live hogs with fresh pork."

""We have taken the appropriate action and the dollar has stabilized,"" Johnson said after testifying to a House Banking subcommittee. He did not elaborate on the nature of the action nor when it was taken, but said that it was in the spirit of the agreement reached by six industrial nations in Paris recently. Johnson said the dollar's decline against other currencies such as the Japanese yen has been gradual. Since the accord by the United States, Britain, West Germany, Japan, France and Canada, foreign exchange markets have been closely watching for indications of intervention by central banks to determine the committment by those nations to their agreement. The nations agreed that currency exchange rates were at about the correct levels when the pact was signed earlier this year."

Under the plan, Chapman will exchange securities and cash for all outstanding 12 pct senior subordinated debentures due 2000 and will sell a controlling interest to Troon Partners Ltd. The agreement with Troon requires Troon to advance 6.5 mln dlrs partially secured by a first mortgage lien on the company's interest in its natural gas pipeline partnership and Troon to tender 100,000 principal amount of debentures to Chapman. Proceeds of the loan will be used for the cash portion of the restructuring. Troon will acquire a majority stock interest and control of the board.

The plan also contemplates establishing a restructured loan providing for one master credit agreement having an aggregate balance of 22.4 mln dlrs. The plan also contemplates the recapitalization of preferred stock whereby each share will be converted into three shares of common stock. Chapman also said it also plans to negotiate settelment and discharge of a substantial portion of its accounts payable and settlement of certain litigation. If approved by various creditors and shareholders, the company expects the plan to be completed by May 29.

""I don't think we should change our economic outlook at the moment,"" Sumita said. Sumita has said in the past that he expects the economy to show a gradual upturn in the second half of the year.

"yen may rise to 140 to the dollar, nikkeiren says",money-fx yen,"The yen could rise to 140 yen to the dollar, a leading Japanese businessman said. Bumpei Otsuki, president of the influential Japan Federation of Employers' Associations, (Nikkeiren), told reporters: ""The yen might rise as far as 140 (to the dollar). The U.S. Economy is not good, and as long as the U.S. Economy is not good, the U.S. Will put various pressures (on Japan)."" ""The yen's level depends on the condition of the U.S. Economy rather than Japan's economy, and as long as the American situation is bad, the yen will continue to rise,"" he said. To cope with the negative impact of the strong yen, Japanese enterprises must strive to cut costs by all means, including holding down wages as much as possible, Otsuki said. He rejected recent calls from some government quarters for wage increases this year as a means of raising private consumption and thus boosting domestic demand. ""We have to keep wages as low as possible,"" he said. He also said the yen's large and rapid rise is depressing the outlook for the Japanese economy, noting that in addition to hurting exporters it is also damaging domestic market manufacturers through cheap imports. Parts of the service sector are also threatened, Otsuki said. Tertiary industries provide services to manufacturers and a downturn in manufacturing profits will adversely affect service industries, he said. It is also doubtful whether the tertiary sector can fully employ those put out of work in the manufacturing sector, he said. Profits of service sector companies are likely to fall in the business year ending in March 1988, leading to a possible recession in the Japanese economy, he said. Otsuki said economic growth is unlikely to pick up beyond levels experienced in 1986. The government's Economic Planning Agency said last week the economy grew at 2.5 pct in 1986, the worst performance since 1974 when the economy shrank 1.4 pct due to the first oil price crisis. In order to stimulate domestic demand and boost the economy, tax reforms aimed at bringing down the cost of land and reforming the nation's housing stock are needed, along with steps to bring down the high cost of commodities, he said."

"japan asks traders, exporters to cut dollar sales",money-fx dlr,"The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has asked about 30 Japanese trading houses and exporters to refrain from excessive dollar selling, trading house officials said. The officials told Reuters MITI asked them to moderate their foreign exchange trading because the excessive rise in the yen will have unfavourable effects on the economy. It made the request by telephone. A MITI official said the ministry has conducted a survey of foreign exchange trading by trade houses and exporters. But he said it was not aimed at moderating dollar selling. The trading house officials said MITI had asked them to undertake foreign exchange transactions with due consideration to the adverse effects excessive exchange rate movements would have on the economy. The MITI official said MITI undertakes such surveys when exchange rates fluctuate widely. A similiar survey was made when the currency fell to the previous record low of 149.98 on January 19. It hit a new record low of 148.20 yen yesterday. He said the survey showed currency transactions by trade houses and exporters contributed little to the dollar fall."
middle east currency market sees key changes,money-fx saudriyal,"Middle East currency dealers meet in Abu Dhabi this weekend at a time of fundamental change in their business, which has seen a growing volume of trade shift from the Arab world to London. The 14th congress of the Inter-Arab Cambiste Association also comes at a time when the prospect of a unified Gulf currency system is more real that at any time this decade. Foreign exchange traders and bank treasurers said these issues, and the slide of the Lebanese pound, can be expected to be major talking points. About 250 traders and treasurers from some 115 banks -- including some in London and other major non-Arab financial centres -- are expected to attend the conference which begins on on Saturday. Bankers said it is hard to avoid the impression that a growing proportion of transactions in the Saudi riyal market, by far the largest in the region, is being carried out in London. The market had been dominated by Saudi Arabia's 11 banks, foreign exchange houses in the Kingdom and offshore banks in Bahrain. But bankers said more and more Saudi and Bahrain-based banks are boosting their treasury operations in London. As recession hit the Middle East and the need for trade finance in the region declined, many offshore banks in Bahrain ran down their currency operations. None of the four major U.K. Clearing banks now has a dealing room on the island. The two major Bahrain-based international banks, <Arab Banking Corp> and <Gulf International Bank BSC> have increased their presence in London and Saudi banks are busy upgrading representative offices to branch status to allow dealing. One economist said: ""It is cheaper to run a riyal book in London than staff an expensive offshore operation in Bahrain... There is now the nucleus of a two-way market in London."" Jeddah-based <Riyad Bank> set up as a licensed deposit taker in London in 1984, while its main rival in Saudi Arabia, <National Commercial Bank> (NCB) won a licence in November 1986. The major market maker has traditionally been London-based consortium bank <Saudi International Bank> but the kingdom joint-venture <Saudi American Bank> (SAMBA) also upgraded its London operation to deposit taker status in mid-February. One senior currency trader in Riyadh said: ""Inevitably the volume of business in London has gained pace with the two new licences for NCB and SAMBA, but there is no question that most of the liquidity still rests in Saudi Arabia."" Currency traders said the shift to London in the Saudi riyal market is difficult to quantify. Bahrain Monetary Agency figures show regional currency deposits held by offshore banks, most in Saudi riyals, dropped to the equivalent of 12.2 billion dlrs at end-September 1986 from 13.4 billion at end-1985 and a 1983 peak of 15.0 billion. The shift has prompted changes in dealing habits. Riyal trading in the Gulf on Saturdays and Sundays has become very quiet with London closed while some Saudi and Bahrain banks now staff offices on Friday, the Gulf weekend. Traders also expect <Arab National Bank> to step up London operations. Traders say it is difficult to foresee the riyal market moving completely out of the region, partly because of local demand and partly because of what is seen as the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency's (SAMA) desire to moderate internationalisation of the riyal and protect it from undue speculation. There have been far fewer signs of the Kuwaiti dinar market shifting from its natural base of Kuwait and trading in Bahrain and London is still limited. But for the first time since the formation of the six nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in 1981 there are signs that a much mooted currency union could come into force soon. Currency traders said it remains unclear what form a final currency union would take for the six states -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. But plans to link the six currencies in a European Monetary System style with a common peg have been discussed at high level and could be a topic on the GCC's annual summit expected to be held in Saudi Arabia late in the year. One dealer said: ""A lot of exposure is being given to discussions and plans appear to be quite advanced. But in the end a political decision has to be taken to give the go-ahead."" One open question is that of a common peg for currencies. The idea of linking the six currencies has been debated since the start of the GCC. The Kuwaiti dinar is currently linked to a basket of currencies while the other five currencies are either officially or in practice linked to the U.S. Dollar. Some traders said a currency union could mean speculation against the Saudi riyal rubbing off on other Gulf currencies, but plans call for a permitted divergence in the system of 7-1/4 pct, large enough to avoid sudden strains. Another topic for debate is expected to be the continued slide of the Lebanese pound against the dollar and the undermining of the effective capital base of Lebanese banks."

"yen may rise to 140 to the dlr, nikkeiren says",money-fx dlr yen,"The yen could rise to 140 yen to the dollar, a leading Japanese businessman said. Bumpei Otsuki, president of the influential Japan Federation of Employers' Associations, (Nikkeiren), told reporters: ""The yen might rise as far as 140 (to the dollar). The U.S. Economy is not good, and as long as the U.S. Economy is not good, the U.S. Will put various pressures (on Japan)."" ""The yen's level depends on the condition of the U.S. Economy rather than Japan's economy, and as long as the American situation is bad, the yen will continue to rise,"" he said. To cope with the negative impact of the strong yen, Japanese enterprises must strive to cut costs by all means, including holding down wages as much as possible, Otsuki said. He rejected recent calls from some government quarters for wage increases this year as a means of raising private consumption and thus boosting domestic demand. ""We have to keep wages as low as possible,"" he said. He also said the yen's large and rapid rise is depressing the outlook for the Japanese economy, noting that in addition to hurting exporters it is also damaging domestic market manufacturers through cheap imports. Parts of the service sector are also threatened, Otsuki said. Tertiary industries provide services to manufacturers and a downturn in manufacturing profits will adversely affect service industries, he said. It is also doubtful whether the tertiary sector can fully employ those put out of work in the manufacturing sector, he said. Profits of service sector companies are likely to fall in the business year ending in March 1988, leading to a possible recession in the Japanese economy, he said. Otsuki said economic growth is unlikely to pick up beyond levels experienced in 1986. The government's Economic Planning Agency said last week the economy grew at 2.5 pct in 1986, the worst performance since 1974 when the economy shrank 1.4 pct due to the first oil price crisis. In order to stimulate domestic demand and boost the economy, tax reforms aimed at bringing down the cost of land and reforming the nation's housing stock are needed, along with steps to bring down the high cost of commodities, he said."
"japan buys modest amount of dollars, dealers say",money-fx dlr,"The Bank of Japan bought a modest amount of dollars this morning, possibly around 200 to 300 mln, dealers said. One dealer said the central bank bought about 200 mln dlrs through brokers and the rest through banks. The buying began when the dollar was at about 149.60 yen, and helped drive the U.S. Currency up to around 150, he said. Another said the central bank seemed to be trying to push the dollar up above 150 yen. But heavy selling at around that level quickly pushed the dollar back down towards 149 yen, dealers said."
japan does not intend to cut discount rate-sumita,interest money-fx,"Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said the central bank has no intention of cutting its discount rate again as a way of preventing the yen's rise. He told a press conference that the growth of Japanese money supply remains high. The bank will have to watch closely various developments resulting from its already eased monetary stance, such as the sharp rise in real estate and stock prices, he said. Although the yen's rise will have a greater deflationary impact on the economy, the economy is not likely to slow down much further, Sumita said. ""I don't think we should change our economic outlook at the moment,"" Sumita said. Sumita has said in the past that he expects the economy to show a gradual upturn in the second half of the year. The governor said the six major industrial nations are expected to review last month's pact on currency stability when they meet next in April. Dealers said they expect the six - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. Amd West Germany - to meet just before the IMF/World Bank interim committee meeting in Washington starting on April 9."
"japan asks traders, exporters to cut dollar sales",money-fx dlr yen,"The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has asked about 30 Japanese trading houses and exporters to refrain from excessive dollar selling, trading house officials said. The officials told Reuters MITI asked them to moderate their foreign exchange trading because the excessive rise in the yen will have unfavourable effects on the economy. It made the request by telephone. A MITI official said the ministry has conducted a survey of foreign exchange trading by trade houses and exporters. But he said it was not aimed at moderating dollar selling. The trading house officials said MITI had asked them to undertake foreign exchange transactions with due consideration to the adverse effects excessive exchange rate movements would have on the economy. The MITI official said MITI undertakes such surveys when exchange rates fluctuate widely. A similiar survey was made when the currency fell to the previous record low of 149.98 on January 19. It hit a new record low of 148.20 yen yesterday. He said the survey showed currency transactions by trade houses and exporters contributed little to the dollar fall."
central banks buy dollars for yen in london,money-fx dlr,"The Bank of Japan intervened to stem strong yen rises against the dollar during London trading this morning, dealers said. The Bank of Japan here declined comment. The Bank of England was also rumored to be buying dollars against the yen this morning but it also declined comment. Dealers said the intervention halted a sudden late morning drop to a low of 148.65 yen, holding the dollar steady until midsession at about 148.80. The Bank of England was strongly rumored to have intervened on behalf of the dollar against the yen yesterday, but it gave no confirmation. Overnight reports from Tokyo said that the Bank of Japan was aggressively supporting the dollar, but failed to push it back to the perceived target level of 150 yen. Selling during the London trading morning was largely attributed to Japanese institutions. Dealers here were loath to quantify the scale of Bank of Japan action this morning. One U.S. Bank trader said it could have been up to 500 mln dlrs, but said this was largely a guess."

bundesbank buys dollars in frankfurt - dealers,money-fx dlr,"The Bundesbank bought large amounts of dollars for yen in an apparent attempt to hold the dollar above 149 yen, dealers said. The dollar intervention was in concert with some other central banks, they said. Dealers said the Bank of Japan and Bank of England supported the dollar against the yen earlier today and that these two banks and the U.S. Federal Reserve were also active yesterday. The Bundesbank declined to comment on the dealers' remarks. Dealers said the intervention underlined the determination of central banks to keep currencies within recent ranges following last month's agreement in Paris by six leading countries to foster currency stability. One dealer said he had been repeatedly in contact with the Bundesbank during the morning to see if it wanted to buy dollars after the Japanese and U.K. Central bank moves. He said the Bundesbank told him it was observing the situation to see if it should intervene in consultation with other central banks. Since the Paris agreement on February 22 the dollar had until yesterday traded in a 1.8150-1.8700 mark range, and above 150 yen, with traders reluctant to push the dollar down to test central banks' resolve to defend currency stability. But the test came this week with the dollar falling below 1.81 marks and 150 yen. Dealers said a reviving trade dispute between Washington and Tokyo and growing sentiment that the dollar would have to fall further to narrow the obstinate U.S. Trade deficit were behind the weakness. This week's intervention showed central banks were prepared to cooperate to defend the Paris pact, dealers said. Dealers said it was significant the West German and British central banks were supporting the dollar against the yen. That showed the pact involved multilateral cooperation by central banks to foster currency stability, they said. But it was unclear how such cooperation was being arranged and how frequent consultations between central banks were."

Some 80,000 hectares of agricultural land and gardens had been inundated, damaging tea plantations and orange groves, the newspaper said. It added that spring sowing in southern parts of the country was some two weeks behind schedule because of the late thaw but gave no precise crop estimates. In the most detailed report to date on the heavy snows in January and floods in February, Izvestia said 8,200 people had been evacuated from mountain areas, 4,500 houses had been damaged and hundreds of kilometres of roads and power lines had been destroyed. A separate article in the daily warned that a sudden thaw was expected shortly in the Ukraine and southern parts of Russia, which experienced record snows this winter. Preventive measures have already been taken in some areas including the evacuation of cattle."

u.s. senate panel approves trade mission bill,trade grain,"The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee approved a bill that would establish farm trade and aid missions to promote the use of U.S. food aid, donation, credit and export subsidy programs by overseas customers. The bill, approved by voice vote, would establish trade missions made up of representatives of the Departments of Agriculture and State, the Agency for International Development, the Overseas Private Investment Corp, market development cooperatives and private voluntary organizations. At least 16 missions would have to be sent within one year after enactment of the bill. The missions would promote U.S. programs, including PL480, Section 416 donations, Export Enhancement Program, the dairy export incentive program, and export credit guarantee programs (GSM-102, GSM-103). The panel agreed to drop a provision in the original bill, offered by Sen. John Melcher (D-Mont.), that would have required the U.S. Agriculture Department to donate at least one mln tonnes of surplus commodities to developing countries. Current law requires USDA to donate at least 750,000 tonnes of surplus grains and dairy products under the Section 416 food donation program. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the proposed increase in the minimum tonnage requirement would have cost up to 50 mln dlrs per year, Senate staff said. The committee also dropped a provision identifying which countries would be the focus of the trade missions' activities. Under the bill adopted by the committee, countries ""friendly to the United States"" would be eligible to host the trade missions. Melcher originally had proposed sending missions to Mexico, the Philippines, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Senegal, Nigeria, Peru, Kenya, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Venezuela, Tunisia and Morocco. The bill also would require the Foreign Agricultural Service, FAS, to have at least 850 full-time employees during fiscal years 1987-89. As of February 28, FAS had 790 full-time employees, a FAS spokesman said."
energy/u.s. oil output,crude nat-gas,"Energy Secretary John Herrington has proposed several ways to boost U.S. oil production, but he said all would cost the Treasury money and will come under close White House scrutiny before action is taken. One measure he said he favored would raise the depletion allowance to 27.5 pct on new oil and gas production as well as production using enhanced extraction methods. Herrington said such a plan would cost 200 mln dlrs a year. The White House, reacting, said it did not favor amending the tax code, but would look at the proposal. Herrington's proposals to spur production were made along with the release last week of the energy department's report on energy and the national security. The report said U.S. oil imports, rapidly rising, could hit 50 pct by the mid 1990s and have potentially damaging implications for national security. He has said since in speeches and at news conferences that any plan he would back to spur lagging domestic oil production would have to meet three criteria--increase production, not cause economic dislocation, and be low cost to the taxpayer. Herrington said an import fee would meet the first test, spurring production but fail the second and third. He said it would raise production and return 120,000 oil workers to their jobs, but at the same time it lifted oil prices, the higher prices would cost 400,000 jobs nationwide and cut the gross national product by 32 billion dlrs. A tax on gasoline, he said, would fail the first criteria by not increasing domestic production. In any case, U.S. officials say, President Reagan remains firmly opposed to an import fee and a gasoline tax. Options which meet Herrington's criteria include: - Loan-price guarantees to shield banks from defaults by borrowers because of lower oil prices. It was estimated that if oil fell to five dlrs a barrel it could trigger defaults that could cost the government an estimated 15 billion dlrs. - A five pct tax credit for exploration and development. It would raise oil and gas production the equivalent of 325,000 barrels a day, at a cost of 740 mln dlrs a year. - A five pct credit only for geological and geophysical expenditures. It would increase production by 80,000 barrels a day, at a cost of 65 mln dlrs. - Lower bid minimums on outer continental shelf acreage to spur exploration. A drop from the present 150 dlrs per acre for the typical 5,760 acre tract to 25 dlrs per acre would lower the cost of the standard tract lease to 144,000 dlrs. Herrington also pressed anew for existing Administration proposals to deregulate natural gas, which he said would cut the need for imported oil by 300,000 barrels daily. He also called again for Congressional approval to explore off the continental shelf, which may hold more than 12 billion barrels of oil, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which may hold nine billion barrels. Herrington said he understood the Reagan's reluctance to amend the newly enacted tax code to fund some of these proposals, but added he hoped his department's energy/security study would make a strong case for the need to help the struggling domestic oil industry. Another move Herrington said he will press anew, even though it had been rejected earlier by the White House, is to raise the fill-rate for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to 100,000 barrels a day from its planned 1988 rate of 35,000. This, he said, would further bolster national security in case of an oil-supply disruption."
"u.s. sugar policy may self-destruct, congressman",sugar grain corn,"A leading U.S. farm-state Congressman, Jerry Huckaby, D-La., warned he will press next year for legislation to control domestic production of sweeteners, perhaps including corn sweeteners, if the industry fails to voluntarily halt output increases this year. ""We're moving toward a direction where we could self-destruct (the U.S. sugar program),"" Rep. Huckaby, chairman of the House agriculture subcommittee dealing with sugar issues, told Reuters in an interview. Huckaby, who told U.S. sugarbeet growers earlier this year they must halt production increases, said he will deliver the same message to Louisiana sugarcane growers Friday. He also said he will soon talk with corn refiners on the subject. Huckaby said the campaign to urge a halt to domestic sweetener output increases is an effort to forestall further cuts in the sugar import quota, now at one mln short tons. ""I think if we're talking about dropping (the quota) another half mln tons, lets say, you're getting to the point where the program might not work,"" he said. ""Ideally, I'd like to freeze things right where we are,"" said Huckaby, leading advocate for sugar growers in Congress. A freeze would mean domestic sugar production at about the current level of 6.5 mln tons, the corn sweetener share of the U.S. market staying at just over 50 pct, and U.S sugar imports holding at about 1.2 mln tons, Huckaby said. A decision on whether to seek legislation will not be made until 1987 output numbers are known late this year, he said. ""I feel like if we didn't expand production, we could probably hold where we are indefinitely, or at least through the 1985 farm bill without any changes (in the sugar program),"" Huckaby said. However, much depends on whether high-fructose corn syrup producers continue to expand their share of the U.S. sweetener market from just over 50 pct, Huckaby said. He noted most estimates are that corn sweeteners will capture at most only another 10 pct of the sweetener market in the U.S. But he said if there were an economic breakthrough in the production of a new crystalline corn sweetener which further expanded the corn sweetener share, then U.S. sugar imports might be eliminated and U.S. sugar output severely reduced. Huckaby said he will deliver this message to corn refiner companies such as A.E. Staley and Archer Daniels Midland soon. ""This program is advantageous to the corn users. They have some natural, legitimate self-interest in seeing that the program is preserved,"" Huckaby said. Huckaby said he has asked sugar industry representatives to think about how domestic output could be controlled, either through production allocations, acreage or marketing controls. Huckaby also said he would be seeking guidance from the Justice Department to determine if it would be legal to ask corn refiners to limit production. ""I don't know if we will go this route, but if we do there's a question in my mind at this point in time; can you do that legally?"" he said. Asked if he would proceed with production controls without the support of corn refiners, Huckaby said ""You build a fragile house if you do it that way."" Huckaby said he understands why U.S. cane and beet farmers have expanded production, because high sugar price support means returns from sugar are higher than competing crops such as soybeans and grain. But he said for sugar growers as a whole, expansion would not be good policy. Huckaby said he has tried to stress, in his speeches to sugar industry groups, that if growers continue to expand, they may be penalized retroactively under any production control legislation passed next year. Huckaby said Congress is unlikely to approve any changes in the sugar program this year despite a Reagan administration proposal to drastically slash the program. ""The administration proposal is so drastic, that I don't think it will get up a head of steam,"" Huckaby said. He said even a more moderate proposal to reduce sugar price support is unlikely to be approved. Instead of seeking to slash the domestic sugar program, Huckaby said the Reagan administration should file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade against the European Community's sugar policy. He said EC policies are the major cause of the depressed world sugar market."
treasury's baker sees cut in trade deficit,trade money-fx,"Treasury Secretary James Baker said the administration is confident the effect of exchange rate changes will bring about a cut in the trade deficit this year.

He told the committee, however, that the ""initial signs are encouraging."""
argentine soybean yield estimates down further,grain corn oilseed soybean sorghum sunseed,"Argentine grain producers again reduced their estimates for the total yield of the 1986/87 soybean crop, which will begin to be harvested in mid-April, trade sources said. They said growers now forecast soybean production this season at between 7.5 and 7.8 mln tonnes, down from last week's estimate of 7.7 to eight mln tonnes and the 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes forecast in mid-February. The new forecast is still higher than last season's record total production. Private sources put 1985/86 production at a record 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes -- 4.2 to 6.4 pct lower than the new forecast for the current crop. The official figure for 1985/86 is 7.1 mln tonnes, 5.6 to 9.9 pct below this season's new estimates. Growers in the past week discovered more empty soybean pods in the main producing areas of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe provinces and northern Buenos Aires. The crop since January has been hit by high temperatures and inadequate rainfall. Growers fear they may find more empty pods and have to further reduce their forecasts of total yield. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct higher than the 1985/86 record of 3.34 mln hectares. The state of the crop continued to be good in general until last week but intense, heavy rains since could have caused damage in areas where rainfall was higher than 100 mm. Where the rains were less heavy they were considered beneficial although too late to improve yield estimates. The rains also benefitted maize and sorghum crops in southern Buenos Aires province but are not expected to influence production forecasts. In other areas, especially western Buenos Aires, where rainfall was more than 200 mm, parts of the sunflower, maize and sorghum crops not yet harvested may have been damaged. The coarse grain crop harvest was interrupted last week by rains which also reached over 100 mm in parts of Cordoba, La Pampa and Santa Fe and almost 90 mm in parts of Entre Rios. The area sown with maize this season was between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares in 1985/86. The yield of 1986/87 maize continued to be forecast at between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes. This estimate is 19.8 to 20.2 pct lower than the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes at which private sources put 1985/86 production and 21.1 to 22.7 pct lower than the official 12.8 mln tonnes. The sunflowerseed harvest has covered 23 to 26 pct of the area sown and continues in parts of central Buenos Aires although at a standstill elsewhere due to rain and floods. A resumption of full harvesting and assessment of damage is impossible until rains stop and a spell of a week to 10 days of sunshine dries the fields. The area sown this season was 2.0 to 2.2 mln hectares, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct on last year's record 3.14 mln hectares. Sunflowerseed 1986/87 production is still forecast at 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes, 34.1 to 41.5 pct below the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln tonnes. The grain sorghum harvest was the least affected by the rains, advancing steadily in Santa Fe and Cordoba and starting in La Pampa to cover 14 to 16 pct of the total area sown. The area sown was 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mln hectares the previous season. Yield estimates remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes, 16.7 to 22 pct down on 1985/86 production of 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes."
texaco <tx> reserves down despite lower output,crude nat-gas,"Texaco Inc's oil and gas reserves declined in 1986 despite reduced production and upward revisions in the company's previous reserve estimates, its annual report said. The statement of the report's auditor was qualified -- as was the previous one -- because of the unkonwn final impact of the judgement won by Pennzoil Co <PZL> against Texaco on charges Texaco interfered with Pannzoil's contract to acquire Getty Oil Co. The auditor's point out, as Texaco has in the past, the company's loss of any of several pending court decisions in this case could cause it ""to face prospects such as having to seek protection of its assets and business pursuant to the bankruptcy and reorganization provisions of Chapter 11"" of the federal bankruptcy code. Commenting on a Texas Court of Appeals ruling which reduced Pennzoil's judgement by two billion dlrs, to 9.1 billion dlrs, Texaco said it will file a motion for a rehearing by the appeals court no later than March 30. Texaco said the proven crude oil reserves of the company and its consolidated subsidiaries totaled 2.54 billion barrels at the end of 1986, down from 2.69 billion a year earlier. However, inclusion of Texaco's equity in the Eastern Hemisphere reserves of a nonsubsidiary company limited the decline to 2.91 billion barrels from 3.00 billion at the end of 1985. Worldwide production by the consolidated subsidiaries declined to 341 mln barrels last year from 362 mln in 1985 and upward revisions in previous reserve estimates rose to 143 mln barrels from 117 mln, respectively. Texaco said the largest drop in reserves came in the United States -- where the total dropped to 1.46 billion barrels from 1.55 billion. The company said U.S. liquids production averaged 660,000 barrels per day last year, down from 714,000 in 1985, with about 44 pct of the decline -- some 24,000 barrels per day -- representing high-cost production shut-in or curtailed in response to the decline in crude oil prices during 1986. Texaco said its natural gas reserves totaled 8.16 trillion cubic feet at year end, down from 8.87 trillion cubic feet at the end of 1985."

The new product, porcine somatotropin (PST) is described as a natural bio-synthetic protein that improves the lean weight and rate of weight gain, as well as reduces the cost of feed for market hogs, the company said. Specific details of the PST production project, including sites for proposed facilities and engineering plans, were not disclosed. International Minerals said it set a completion target for the spring of 1989, by which time necessary Food and Drug Administration approvals are expected to be obtained."
brazil wants to increase steel exports to u.s.,trade iron-steel,"Brazil wants to increase its steel exports to the United States, now limited because of tough import restraints set in 1984 by the Reagan administration, a spokeswoman for the Brazilian Steel Institute (IBS) said. Brazilian and U.S. Trade officials held the first of a three-day meeting today in Brasilia to discuss the issue. In 1984, after three months of painstaking negotiations, the U.S. Government reached accords with seven steel-exporting nations - Australia, Brazil, Japan, Mexico, Spain, South Africa and South Korea - to reduce their shipments to the United States by about 30 pct in 1985. The 1984 restraints established that for 1987 Brazil's steel exports to the U.S. Could not exceed 632,000 tonnes, increasing to 640,000 tonnes in 1988 and 670,000 tonnes in 1989, the last of the five-year deadline set by the agreements. Brazilian officials are trying to increase Brazil's export share of non-flat products to the U.S. Market. The spokeswoman said there were reports of domestic supply problems in the United States."
lower u.s. soybean loan idea sharply criticized,oilseed soybean,"U.S. soybean lobbyists and congressional aides criticized a proposal from a senior Agriculture Department official that Congress allow the U.S. soybean loan level to be officially lowered to 4.56 dlrs per bushel next year. ""I don't know who in Congress would propose that happening. Politically it would be totally unacceptable,"" an aide to a senior farm-state senator said. USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said this week that Congress should give USDA authority to keep the soybean loan at its current effective rate of 4.56 dlrs per bushel rather than increasing it to its minimum allowed level of 4.77 dlrs. ""I'm convinced that Congress will not go along with this,"" American Soybean Association President Dave Haggard said. Amstutz told reporters following a senate hearing that if the soybean loan rate were 4.56 dlrs, USDA could then consider ways to make U.S. soybeans more competitive. His comments were seen as possibly indicating what the the administration's position is in the debate over what should be done to make soybeans competitive and at the same time protect soybean farmers' income. Using soybean specific certificates to further buydown the loan rate or implementation of a marketing loan have been pointed to as the most effective ways to get soybean prices competitive. USDA secretary Richard Lyng, however, continues to maintain his opposition to a marketing loan, saying such a move would be too costly. ""There will be alot of other options that will be considered before Congress looks at that one (the Amstutz proposal,"" said Bill O'Conner, aide to Rep. Edward Madigan (R-Ill), ranking minority leader of the Agriculture Committee. ""Anybody representing large groups of soybean producers would not be very excited about supporting a lower soybean loan,"" O'Conner said. Congress may very likely look at the soybean loan and decide that they cannot increase it from its current 5.02 dlr basic rate, but that there has to be something mandated to increase soybean's competitiveness, David Graves, aide to Sen.

recent u.s. oil demand up 0.1 pct from year ago,crude gas,"U.S. oil demand as measured by products supplied rose 0.1 pct in the four weeks ended March 20 to 16.16 mln barrels per day from 16.15 mln in the same period a year ago, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said. In its weekly petroleum status report, the Energy Department agency said distillate demand was off 0.1 pct in the period to 3.258 mln bpd from 3.260 mln a year earlier. Gasoline demand averaged 6.72 mln bpd, off 1.2 pct from 6.80 mln last year, while residual fuel demand was 1.38 mln bpd, off 2.1 pct from 1.41 mln, the EIA said. Domestic crude oil production was estimated at 8.35 mln bpd, down 7.8 pct from 9.06 mln a year ago, and gross daily crude imports (excluding those for the SPR) averaged 3.44 mln bpd, up 16.3 pct from 2.95 mln, the EIA said. Refinery crude runs in the four weeks were 11.90 mln bpd, up 1.4 pct from 11.74 mln a year earlier, it said. In the first 78 days of the year, refinery runs were up 1.8 pct to an average 12.25 mln bpd from 12.04 mln in the year-ago period, the EIA said. Year-to-date demand for all petroleum products averaged 16.32 mln bpd, up 1.8 pct from 16.04 mln in 1986, it said. So far this year, distillate demand rose 0.1 pct to 3.31 mln bpd from 3.30 mln in 1986, gasoline demand was 6.60 mln bpd, up 0.1 pct from 6.59 mln, and residual fuel demand fell 0.4 pct to 1.42 mln bpd from 1.43 mln, the EIA said. Year-to-date domestic crude output was estimated at 8.41 mln bpd, off 7.7 pct from 9.11 mln a year ago, while gross crude imports averaged 3.96 mln bpd, up 28.1 pct from 3.09 mln, it said."
unocal <ucl> plans increase in capital spending,crude nat-gas,"Unocal Corp said it intends to increase its spending for capital projects to 929 mln dlrs in 1987, eight pct more than the 862 mln spent in 1986. The company said in its annual report that it would increase spending for exploration and development of petroleum resources by about three pct to 614 mln dlrs from 1986's 595 mln dlrs, assuming oil prices hold around current levels. The planned spending for exploration and production in 1987 remains well below the 1.1 billion dlrs spent in 1985, Unocal said. The company's proved developed and undeveloped reserves of crude oil rose slightly in 1986, Unocal said. Net crude oil and condensate reserves were 752 mln bbls as of Dec 31, 1986, compared to 751 mln bbls at the end of 1985, Unocal said. The company said its net crude oil and condensate production averaged 248,200 barrels per day in 1986 compared to 251,300 bpd in 1985. Unocal said its worldwide natural gas reserves were 6.07 billion cubic feet in 1986 compared to 1985's 6.19 billion. Net natural gas output averaged 976 mln cubic feet per day in 1986, down 10 pct from 1985's 1,084 mln, the company said. Unocal said its average sales prices for crude oil was 12.67 dlrs a barrel worldwide in 1986 compared to 23.81 dlrs in 1985, and its average sales price for natural gas was 2.03 dlrs per thousand cubic feet in 1986 against 2.24 dlrs in 1985. Average production costs for crude oil and natural gas declined nearly 30 pct to 3.41 dlrs per bbl of oil equivalent in 1986 from 4.81 dlrs in 1985, Unocal said. In the annual report, the company called for imposition of an oil import fee by the U.S. government to set a floor price of about 25 dlrs a barrel for crude oil. ""Simply stabilizing prices at about 18 dlrs per barrel will not materialy slow the drop in U.S. production or the rise in imports,"" Chairman Fred Hartley said in the annual report. ""Without decisive action in Washington, this nation will once again become a hostage to OPEC's plans and policies,"" Hartley said."
pennzoil (pzl) willing to settle texaco (tx) lawsuit,crude nat-gas,"Pennzoil Co said it had not yet received any ""meaningful settlement offer"" from Texaco Inc but added that the company remained willing to consider proposals to settle the 10.2 billion dlr jury judgment it won against Texaco. In its newly-released annual report to shareholders, Pennzoil said it expected the Texas state court judgment, which was upheld by a state appeals court on February 12, to be upheld if appealed again. ""To date, Pennzoil has yet to receive any meaningful settlement offer from Texaco, though it remains open to any realistic effort to settle the matter,"" Pennzoil chairman Hugh Liedtke said in the annual report. Pennzoil also said it had budgeted 212 mln dlrs for capital spending in 1987, a drop from the 233 mln dlrs spent last year. Proved U.S. and foreign reserves of natural gas declined to 964 billion cubic feet last year, from 1.01 trillion cubic feet in 1985, because of a virtual halt in its exploration program, Pennzoil said. Its crude oil reserves dropped to 140 mln barrels from 158 mln barrels in 1985. The Houston-based company said it sold an average of 339 mln cubic feet of domestic natural gas each day last year, a 17 pct drop from 1985. The average sales price for gas dropped by 60 cents per mcf to 2.16 dlrs per mcf, Pennzoil said. U.S. crude oil and gas liquids production last year fell to an average of 33,290 barrels per day from 34,102 barrels per day in 1985. The company's total revenues in 1986 declined to 482.3 mln dlrs, from 762.5 mln dlrs the previous year. Operating income in 1986 fell more than 80 pct, to 38.0 mln dlrs. Pennzoil said its goals for 1987 included development of its Point Arguello oilfield off the California coast, to maintain current production levels in its Bluebell-Altamont Field in Utah and to drill for prospects in the Gulf of Mexico's Mobile Bay area. ""Production should begin late in the year from the Harvest Platform in the Santa Maria Basin offshore California,"" the company said. ""Pennzoil's share of this production initially should be five thousand barrels a day, increasing to a peak of 15 thousand barrels a day, net, by 1989."" In its sulphur business, Pennzoil said production totaled 2.1 mln long tons last year, a decline of 18 pct from 1985. The average sales price also declined, to 138.25 dlrs per long ton from 141.05 dlrs in 1985. ""The long term outlook for our sulphur operations remains bright,"" the company said. ""We expect sulphur's pricing structure to strengthen during the current year, probably in the third and fourth quarters."""
exchange rate bill clears u.s. house panel,money-fx interest,"The House Banking Committee adopted legislation to direct the U.S. Treasury to begin negotiations aimed at seeking regular adjustment of exchange rates by countries such as Taiwan and South Korea, whose currencies are pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar. The measure was adopted as part of a wide-ranging trade bill that will be considered by the full House in April before it moves on to the Senate. The bill's many provisions also set as a priority for the U.S. the negotiation of stable exchange rates and urge government intervention as necessary to offset fluctuations. In addition, the Banking Committee bill would authorize U.S. banks to use a variety of means to deal with the debt problems of developing countries, such as lowering interest rates on existing debt, renegotiating loans or debt forgiveness. The bill would give a blanket waiver of any federal banking regulations that bar such actions. The bill would direct Treasury Secretary James Baker to discuss with debt-ridden developing countries the possibility of the U.S. setting up a public debt management agency that would purchase their debt at a discount and negotiate the restructuring of the debt. The Banking bill authorizes U.S. participation in a multilateral investment guarantee agency (MIGA) as requested by the administration. Congress would approve an initial U.S. subscription of 22 mln dlrs. And, it sets up a council on industrial competitiveness composed of industry and administration members to explore ways to make the U.S. more competitive in world markets."
cost of pik certificates to be eyed by congress,grain corn,"Congress, eager to find budget savings, launches a review of the U.S. Agriculture Department's generic commodity certificate program tomorrow, amid signs USDA and the General Accounting Office, GAO, are at odds over how much the program has cost U.S. taxpayers. The GAO concluded in a preliminary report last week that payment-in-kind, or PIK, certificates cost between five and 20 pct more than cash outlays, administration officials who asked not to be identified said. USDA officials, however, took issue with the report, saying it did not take into account storage, handling and transport savings that accrue to the government. The GAO then decided to re-examine the costs, sources said. The issue is an important one, because congressional budget committees are known to be considering limiting the use of certificates as a means of cutting spending. Agriculture Under Secretary Daniel Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate Director Brian Crowley are set to testify before the Senate Agriculture Committee tomorrow. Amstutz is expected to tell the committee that there are uncertainties in determining the cost of certificates compared to cash outlays, and that savings to the Commodity Credit Corp, CCC, almost equal costs, department sources said. USDA estimates that it costs the government about 75 cents to store, handle and transport each bushel of commodity put in government storage. It was unclear whether the GAO, Congress' investigative arm, would stick by its original analysis that it costs the government more to use certificates instead of cash in farm price and income support programs, Reagan administration sources said. The GAO is expected to point out that use of payment-in-kind, PIK, certificates has helped relieve tight storage by moving grain that otherwise might not have been sold. The testimony by Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate Director Brian Crowley comes as congressional budget committees intensify their efforts to pinpoint ways to cut the federal budget deficit -- including considering limits on the use of PIK certificates. The CCC issues dollar-denominated PIK certificates, or certs, as a partial substitute for direct cash outlays to farmers or cash subsidies to exporters. Certs can be used to repay nonrecourse loans or exchanged for CCC commodities or cash. Between April and December 1986, CCC issued 3.8 billion dlrs worth of certificates, according to USDA. Up to another 6.7 billion dlrs worth could be issued between January and August 1987, according to USDA. Certs can cost the government more than cash primarily because recipients can use the certificates to pay back government loans at levels below the loan rate. Eliminating this practice, called ""PIK and roll,"" would save the government 1.4 billion dlrs between 1988-92, according to the Congressional Budget Office, CBO. That estimate, according to a CBO official, was based on an assumption that certificates cost the government about 15 pct more than cash payments. The Senate and House Budget Committees are known to be considering curbs on PIK-and-roll transactions among other savings alternatives. The GAO last week reached the tentative conclusion that the estimated three billion dlrs of certificates redeemed to date have cost the federal government between 150 mln and 600 mln dlrs, or between five and 20 pct, more than cash outlays, one administration official said. However, the GAO has decided to reassess those estimates based in part on USDA criticism, department officials said. The broad range of the cost estimate is partly attributable to the different effect certificates can have on market prices over the course of a crop year. USDA's Economic Research Service, for example, has found that between June and August last year, the 215 mln bushels of corn exchanged for certificates lowered the price of corn by between 35 and 45 cents per bushel. Between September and November, however, certificates had only a marginal impact on corn prices, according to the ERS study, obtained by Reuters."
"further yen rise would hurt japan economy, sumita",money-fx yen interest,"Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said a further yen rise would have adverse effects on the Japanese economy. He told Japanese business leaders the Bank of Japan will continue to take adequate measures, including market intervention, to stabilize exchange rates if necessary, in close cooperation with other major industrialized nations. He said the current instability of exchange rates will not last. Six major nations - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - agreed in Paris last month to act together to hold currencies stable. Sumita said the Bank of Japan will continue to pursue adequate and flexible monetary policies while watching economic and financial developments in and outside Japan. He said the decision to cut the discount rate on February 20 was a hard choice for the Bank because monetary conditions had already been sufficiently eased. To prevent a resurgence of inflation, the Bank will take a very cautious stance regarding developments stemming from easy credit conditions, he said. He said the latest discount rate cut to 2.5 pct should stabilize exchange rates and expand domestic demand. Commenting on the dollar's fall below 150 yen, Sumita reiterated he cannot find any specific reason for the currency's weakness. The market undertook speculative dollar selling by reacting to overseas comments by monetary authorities and trade tension, he said. Sumita repeated that the Japanese economy may gradually recover in the latter half of the 1987/88 fiscal year ending April 1, 1988, provided exchange rates stabilize."

bank of france launches money market tender,money-fx interest,"The Bank of France said it set a money market intervention tender today to inject funds to the market against first category paper. Money market sources said the surprise announcement might herald a quarter percentage point cut in the central bank intervention rate from the 7-3/4 pct level set March 10, but they added such a cut was relatively unlikely. The intervention rate was cut from eight pct on March 10 after being raised from 7-1/4 pct on January 2 to head off speculative pressure against the franc. Dealers said market fundamentals could justify a further easing, but a combination of technical factors and renewed currency uncertainties surrounding the dollar had put short-term upside pressure on interest rates in recent sessions. Call money rose yesterday to 7-7/8 eight pct from 7-3/4 7/8 pct. Today it was first indicated at 8-1/8 1/4 before easing on news of the tender to 7-13/16 7/8 pct. Technical factors making for a slight shortage of liquidity in the market included the settlement yesterday of the latest monthly treasury tap stock tender, on March 5, market sources said."
german current account surplus widens in february,bop trade,"West Germany's current account surplus widened to a provisional 6.6 billion marks in February from a slightly downwards revised 4.8 billion in January, a spokeswoman for the Federal Statistics Office said. The trade surplus in February widened to a provisional 10.4 billion marks from 7.2 billion in January, she added. The Statistics Office had originally put the January current account surplus at 4.9 billion marks. The February trade surplus was well up on the 6.84 billion mark surplus posted in the same month of 1986. But the current account surplus was down slightly from the 6.85 billion surplus recorded in February 1986. A Statistics Office statement said the widening of the February current account surplus compared with January was due to seasonal factors. Neither the trade nor current account figures are seasonally adjusted. February imports, measured in terms of value, totalled 32.11 billion marks, a decline of 10 pct against February 1986 but a rise of 5.5 pct against January. Exports in February, also in value terms, totalled 42.56 billion marks, 0.5 pct less than in February 1986 but up 13 pct compared with January. The Statistics Office said it was not yet able to calculate the real change in exports and imports in February. But for comparison purposes it noted that in January the average value of imports had fallen 15 pct year-on-year while the average value of exports had declined by only 4.4 pct. Within the current account, the services account had 300 mln marks deficit, supplementary trade items a 200 mln mark surplus while transfer payments posted a 3.7 billion mark deficit. Taking the first two months of 1987 together, imports in value terms fell 14 pct to 62.6 billion marks compared with a year earlier. The value of exports totalled 80.2 billion marks, a decline of 7.4 pct against the same months of 1986. The resulting trade surplus of 17.6 billion marks for January/February compares with a cumulative surplus of 14.1 billion marks in the year-ago period. The cumulative current account surplus for January and February 1987 totalled 11.3 billion marks against 11.4 billion marks a year earlier, the Statistics Office said. Bank economists said the rise in the February trade surplus reflected an improvement in the terms of trade as well as seasonal factors. The Federal Statistics Office said earlier this week that February import prices fell 0.7 pct against January while export prices were unchanged. ""The rise in the nominal figures masks a lower export trend that is not expected to change for several months at least,"" said an economist. He said the nominal trade surplus for 1987 as a whole is likely to fall only slightly from the record 112.2 billion marks in 1986 but other economists said the surplus could fall to around 80 billion marks. An economist at the Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft (BfG) in Frankfurt said a two-month comparison of trade figures gave a more accurate picture of West Germany's trade position. He noted the 17.6 billion mark surplus for January and February together was lower than the 21.6 billion mark surplus posted in November and December. ""The trend is clearly lower,"" he said. This economist, who declined to be named, said the February rise was also partly explained by special factors in January, when there had been a number of public holidays as well as extremely cold weather, both of which hindered trade."

Despite the figures, the budget forecast of about 1.75 pct annual growth in employment would be met, Keating said. Unemployment is currently at 8.2 pct of the workforce. ""This government is dragging Australia through a trading holocaust the kind of which we have not seen since the Second World War,"" Keating said. ""We are not pushing this place into a recession.

japan beef price support cut will not raise demand,livestock carcass,"Japan's plan to cut beef intervention prices for the fiscal year starting April 1 will not boost demand because of strict supply controls and a complex distribution system, Japanese and U.S. Industry sources said. ""Government beef policy protects farmers rather than meeting consumers' demands and the cutback ... Is too marginal,"" a Housewives Association of Japan official said. Despite mounting U.S. Pressure on Japan to open farm markets, beef is strictly controlled by the government, which maintains a price stabilisation zone to protect farmers. Under the plan, expected to be announced this month, the standard or bottom price of castrated wagyu -- known as marbled beef -- will be set at 1,370 yen per kilo for 1987/88 against 1,400 now, and the ceiling at 1,780 yen against 1,820. The standard price of other beef, mainly produced from dairy steers, is set at 1,020 yen against 1,090 and the ceiling at 1,325 against 1,420. Ministry officials said the semi-government Livestock Industry Promotion Corp (LIPC) conducts buffer stock operations to help keep wholesale beef prices within the intervention price zone. The LIPC is allowed to import most beef, with the amount set by the government under a quota system. When wholesale prices go above the ceiling, the LIPC releases its beef stocks, both domestic and imported, and buys locally produced beef when prices are below. But the LIPC has often been criticised for releasing beef stocks when the prices are higher than the ceiling. Phillip Seng, Asian Director of the U.S. Meat Export Federation, told Reuters the two pct cut in prices is a step toward closing the gap with European Community prices, about half those in Japan. But Seng said the cut will not benefit consumers or U.S. Meat exporters because of Japan's rigid and complicated distribution system and strict supply control by the LIPC. The Housewives Association official said retail beef prices are high mainly because of distribution problems and high production costs, as well as poor operations by the LIPC. American meat packers see Japan as a promising market. F.C. Beatty, of U.S. Packer John Morrell and Co, told the Japan Times beef cuts, which sell for 1.20 to 3.00 dlrs a pound in the U.S., Are sold at 15 to 30 dlrs in Japan.

U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said this week he will ask Japan to remove all beef import restrictions when he visits here next month. In 1984, Japan decided to increase its beef import quota by 9,000 tonnes a year until March 31, 1988. In 1987/88, the quota will rise to 177,000 tonnes from 168,000 in 1986/87, ministry officials said, adding Japan wants to keep self-sufficiency in beef at around 70 pct."

u.k. visible trade deficit narrows in february,trade bop,"Britain's visible trade deficit narrowed to a seasonally adjusted provisional 224 mln stg in February from 527 mln in January, The Trade and Industry Department said. The current account balance of payments in February showed a seasonally adjusted provisional surplus of 376 mln stg compared with a surplus of 73 mln in January. Invisibles in February were put provisionally at a 600 mln surplus, the same as in January. Seasonally adjusted, imports rose in February to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January. Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion last month from 6.20 billion in January. Trade Department officials said the improvement in Britain's current account contrasted with most private forecasts and they attributed much of the strength to imports rising less quickly in February than might otherwise have been expected. The Department said exceptionally cold weather in January reduced exports that month and that there had been an element of catching up in the February figures. The seasonally adjusted volume index, base 1980, a guide to underlying non-oil trade, showed exports rising to 131.0 from 114.6 in January and imports rising to 142.2 from 136.5. The value of British oil exports in February rose to 751 mln stg from 723 mln in Jnauary while oil imports rose to 425 mln from 352 mln. The Department said the upward trend in non-oil export volume continues and the underlying level of non-oil import volume seems to have stablised. The Departnment said exports to the U.S. May be benefiting from fluctuations in the mark and yen exchange rates."
iwc lifts world grain output estimate to record,grain wheat,"The International Wheat Council (IWC) lifted its estimate for 1986/87 world wheat and coarse grain production by one mln tonnes to a record 1,377 mln, compared with 1,351 mln tonnes the previous season. In its monthly market report, the IWC said it is leaving unchanged its forecast of world wheat production for the coming 1987/88 season at between 520 and 530 mln tonnes against a record 534 mln in 1986/87. The one mln tonne upward revision in 1986/87 wheat production reflects several minor adjustments. The IWC raised the 1986/87 coarse grain trade figure two mln to 87 mln tonnes. It left wheat trade unchanged at 86 mln. The IWC 1986/87 estimate for world trade in wheat and coarse grain is thus estimated two mln tonnes higher at 173 mln against 169 mln the previous season with the forecast three mln rise in Soviet imports offset by small reductions elsewhere. The IWC said the area harvested for wheat in 1987/88 is likely to be down from last year as low world prices and restrictive national policies measures begin to take effect. At least four of the five major exporters expect to see a drop in wheat sowings without offset in other countries. There is still potential for even higher average wheat yields but the IWC said there are increasing signs world output may level off. Although it is still early to assess the coarse grain outlook, the IWC said barley acreage is likely to fall in the European Community but increase in Canada. U.S. Maize area is expected lower but oat sowings could rise. After damage to its maize crop last year, the Soviet Union plans to expand this area by as much as 50 pct to over six mln hectares in a year when many frost damaged wheat fields are likely to be resown to this and other spring crops. Improved weather and a further increase in the use of intensive cultivation methods could therefore see a marked rise in Soviet maize output in 1987, the IWC said. Any reduction in world coarse grain output would be bolstered by the large carryover stocks from 1986/87, the IWC said. It left its estimates of wheat and coarse grain stocks at endof different marketing years unchanged at 178 and 210 mln tonnes, respectively, against 160 and 167 mln a year earlier. After record world durum wheat production of 218.8 mln tonnes last season, the IWC said there are already signs of another large crop this coming season with higher output expected in the EC, Canada, the U.S. And North Africa."

u.k. trade figures buoy hopes of interest rate cut,trade bop interest money-fx,"The release of U.K. February trade data showing that the current account surplus was a provisional 376 mln stg, up from a 73 mln surplus in January, has boosted hopes of an early cut in interest rates, analysts said. Market forecasts had been for a worse outcome, with expectations of a deficit in visible trade averaging about 750 mln stg, against the official figure of 224 mln stg, sharply narrower than January's 527 mln deficit. ""The figures are unreservedly good,"" Chase Manhattan Securities economist Andrew Wroblewski said. Sterling rebounded on the trade figures, reversing a weaker morning trend, to stand at 72.1 pct of its trade weighted index against a basket of currencies at midday, unchanged from yesterday's close but 0.3 points above the 1100 GMT level. The market had feared that a deteriorating non-oil trade pattern would undermine international support for sterling, which has been the motor behind the recent fall in U.K. Interest rates. Money market sources said the market had begun to doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending rates to 9.5 pct from the present 10.0 pct was really on the cards. But sentiment now looks to have turned about again. There now looks to be no danger that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's forecast of a 1987 current account deficit of 2.5 billion stg will be exceeded, Wroblewski said. Seasonally adjusted figures showed imports rose in February to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January. Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion from 6.20 billion. However, Chris Tinker, U.K. Analyst at brokers Phillips and Drew said the faster rise in exports than imports would prove partly aberrational in coming months. He forecast the Chancellor's Budget tax cuts would increase consumer expenditure on imported goods. However, Warburg Securities economist Ian Harwood said his firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit forecast in the light of the latest data, cutting one billion stg off the expected full year total to about 1.75 billion stg. He said news of strong growth in exports of non-oil goods confirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the Confederation of British Industry. The growth in imports appears to be flattening, even if January's bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas goods and import-intensive stock building among manufacturers, Harwood said. U.K. Government bonds, or gilts, surged by more than 1/2 point on the better-than-expected news, as earlier worries about the figures evaporated. Sterling peaked at a high of 1.6075 dlrs, before settling to a steady 1.6050 about 1300 GMT, nearly a cent higher than the European low of 1.5960. However, analysts noted that the turnabout in market sentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news. Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was largely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the Conservative government's support was slipping. LONDON, March 26 - The Bank of England said it provided 15 mln stg in assistance to the money market this morning, buying bank bills in band two at 9-13/16 pct. Earlier the Bank revised its money market liquidity forecast from a flat position to a deficit of around 350 mln stg."
iwc says effect of lower support prices limited,grain wheat,"Efforts by governments to control wheat surpluses by cutting support prices have met with only partial success, the International Wheat Council (IWC) says in its latest monthly report. Faster results could be achieved by a policy of reducing both price and areas, as employed in the United States, the IWC says in a survey of support prices in the five main wheat exporters - Argentina, Australia, Canada, the EC and the U.S. In some countries, for example Australia and Argentina, which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for export income, there may be problems in reducing production. A policy of cutting wheat production could lead to unemployment, with job prospects outside agriculture limited. Alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could then lead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems. The IWC outlines three courses of action open to governments in wheat exporting countries. They could continue to support prices in the hope that when the world economy improves demand for wheat will rise and surpluses wil be reduced or eliminated. Alternatively, support could be limited to wheat which could be easily sold, without needing to be stored for a long period. This option may prove to be the most politically unattractive and would result in many producers abandoning wheat production, the report said. The third option would be for governments to distinguish between the commercial and social aspects of agriculture, possibly varying support prices according to farm size or overall production. The IWC review covers support prices in the major exporting countries since 1982. At some time during that period all the producers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses. These changes did not always result in lower export subsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more than offset lower prices in the domestic currency. For example between 1985/86 and 1986/87 the EC intervention price for bread wheat fell from 209.30 to 179.44 European currency units (Ecus). It dollar terms, the currency in which most export transactions are denominated, the intervention price however rose to 193 dlrs from 168. The high cost of supporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequers and some governments are now searching for ways to cut expenditure, the report says. The proportion of world wheat output produced by the five major exporters declined in the period covered by the survey from 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987. This was partly due to increased production in China and India. The period saw an upward trend in yields, although this was countered in the Argentina, the U.S. And Australia by lower acreages. In Argentina a reduction in the sown area of about 20 per cent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch to other enterprises, particularly livestock while lower U.S. Acreages are attributed to official incentives."

baker sees 15 to 20 billion dlr drop in trade gap,trade bop,"Treasury Secretary James Baker said he expected the U.S. Trade deficit to fall by 15 billion to 20 billion dlrs in 1987. Commenting on the deficit during an interview on Cable News Network, Baker said ""I think you're going to see a 15 to 20 billion dlr reduction this year."" The deficit was 170 billion dlrs in 1986. Baker noted that the benefits of a weaker currency take 12 to 18 months to affect the trade balance, and said it is now 18 months since the Plaza agreement to lower the dollar's value."
u.k. visible trade deficit narrows in february,trade bop,"Britain's visible trade deficit narrowed to a seasonally adjusted provisional 224 mln stg in February from 527 mln in January, The Trade and Industry Department said. The current account balance of payments in February showed a seasonally adjusted provisional surplus of 376 mln stg compared with a surplus of 73 mln in January. Invisibles in February were put provisionally at a 600 mln surplus, the same as in January. Seasonally adjusted, imports rose in February to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January. Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion last month from 6.20 billion in January. Trade Department officials said the improvement in Britain's current account contrasted with most private forecasts and they attributed much of the strength to imports rising less quickly in February than might otherwise have been expected. The Department said exceptionally cold weather in January reduced exports that month and that there had been an element of catching up in the February figures. The seasonally adjusted volume index, base 1980, a guide to underlying non-oil trade, showed exports rising to 131.0 from 114.6 in January and imports rising to 142.2 from 136.5. The value of British oil exports in February rose to 751 mln stg from 723 mln in Jnauary while oil imports rose to 425 mln from 352 mln."
hong kong february trade swings into deficit,trade bop,"Hong Kong recorded a 3.51 billion H.K. Dlr deficit in February after a 2.54 billion dlr surplus in January as imports climbed and exports slid, the Census and Statistics Department said. The deficit compared with a deficit of 1.76 billion dlrs in February 1986. Imports rose to 24.12 billion dlrs, up 2.6 pct from January's 23.52 billion dlrs and 42 pct above the 16.98 billion dlrs recorded in February 1986. Total exports for the month fell 20.9 pct to 20.61 billion dlrs from 26.06 billion in January. February exports were still 35.4 pct above the 15.22 billion dlrs recorded in the same month last year. Re-exports, the territory's traditional entrepot trade, outpaced domestically produced exports for the first time since March 1985. Re-exports fell 11.6 pct to 10.62 billion dlrs from 12.0 billion dlrs in January but were 54 pct above February 1986's 6.88 billion dlrs. Domestic exports slid 28.9 pct to 9.99 billion dlrs from January's 14.05 billion dlrs but were up 19.7 pct over the 8.35 billion dlrs recorded in February 1986."
u.k. trade figures buoy hopes of interest rate cut,trade bop interest stg money-fx,"The release of U.K. February trade data showing that the current account surplus was a provisional 376 mln stg, up from a 73 mln surplus in January, has boosted hopes of an early cut in interest rates, analysts said. Market forecasts had been for a worse outcome, with expectations of a deficit in visible trade averaging about 750 mln stg, against the official figure of 224 mln stg, sharply narrower than January's 527 mln deficit. ""The figures are unreservedly good,"" Chase Manhattan Securities economist Andrew Wroblewski said. Sterling rebounded on the trade figures, reversing a weaker morning trend, to stand at 72.1 pct of its trade weighted index against a basket of currencies at midday, unchanged from yesterday's close but 0.3 points above the 1100 GMT level. The market had feared that a deteriorating non-oil trade pattern would undermine international support for sterling, which has been the motor behind the recent fall in U.K. Interest rates. Money market sources said the market had begun to doubt that a widely expected drop in bank base lending rates to 9.5 pct from the present 10.0 pct was really on the cards. But sentiment now looks to have turned about again. There now looks to be no danger that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's forecast of a 1987 current account deficit of 2.5 billion stg will be exceeded, said Wroblewski. Seasonally adjusted figures showed that imports rose in February to 7.16 billion stg from 6.73 billion in January. Exports rose to a record 6.93 billion from 6.20 billion. However, Chris Tinker, U.K. Analyst at brokers Phillips and Drew said that the faster rise in exports than imports would prove partly aberrational in coming months. He forecast the Chancellor's Budget tax cuts would increase consumer expediture on imported goods. However, Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, said his firm was sharply revising its 1987 current account deficit forecast in the light of the latest data, cutting one billion stg off the expected full year total to about 1.75 billion stg. He said news of strong growth in exports of non-oil goods confirmed recent bullish surveys among members of the Confederation of British Industry. The growth in imports appears to be flattening, even if January's bad weather had curbed consumer spending on overseas goods and import-intensive stock building among manufactureres, Harwood said. U.K. Government bonds, or gilts, surged by more than 1/2 point on the better-than-expected news, as earlier worries about the figures evaporated. Sterling peaked at a high of 1.6075 dlrs, before settling to a steady 1.6050 dlrs about 1300 GMT, nearly a cent higher than the European low of 1.5960. However, analysts noted that the turnabout in market sentiment still looks highly vulnerable to political news. Morning weakness in sterling and the gilt market was largely attributed to a newspaper opinion poll showing that the Conservative government's support was slipping. The Marplan poll, published in ""Today,"" showed Conservative support had fallen to 36 pct, from 38 pct last month, while the Alliance of Liberals and Social Democrats had rallied to 31 pct, from 21 pct, to run neck and neck with the Labour Party, whose own support fell from 38 pct. The poll was taken after the Budget, which was greeted enthusiastically by financial markets but seems to have left the voters indifferent, political observers said. Another regular poll is due tomorrow, and eonomists warn that today's improved sentiment could be dented if support for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher slips again. This upsetting of the markets' political perceptions, which are all but discounting a Conservative victory in the upcoming general election, made them more sensitive to the trade data, Harwood said. ""The news did come as a very, very substantial relief,"" he said. However, on the interest rate front, economists caution that Lawson might be wary of leaving sterling vulnerable by encouraging another base rate fall. They noted Lawson had already got an inflation-reducing cut in mortgage rates in response to lower base rates, so domestic political reasons for lower rates have been curtailed."

Huh Sun-yong, who will attend the talks with three other Seoul government officials, told Reuters that Seoul was ""positively considering buying a certain amount of Alaskan oil beginning this year as part of our government's overall plan to reduce a widening trade gap between the two countries.""

u.s treasury's mulford reaffirms g-6 agreement,money-fx trade,"Treasury Assistant Secretary David Mulford reaffirmed U.S. backing for the Paris Agreement among six industrial nations to cooperate closely to foster exchange rate stability around current levels. In testimony prepared for delivery before a Senate banking subcommittee, Mulford said there was broad recognition in Paris that ""further substantial exchange rate shifts could damage growth and adjustment prospects."" But he also said while there are clear understandings among the countries regarding cooperation, ""We have refrained from establishing a system of target zones or ranges."" Mulford also said the six nations have not spelled out the way in which they intend to deal with possible market developments. He said governments must retain flexibility in dealing with exchange market pressures and efforts to establish rigid exchange rate objectives ""or to specify too precisely the goals of intervention"" would hurt official attempts to react to market pressures, he said. Accordingly, Mulford said setting specific currency objectives and intervention to achieve those objectives would be counterproductive. Commenting on the trade deficit, Mulford reiterated the Treasury position that the current account deficit will decline from 148 billion dlrs last year to around 130 billion dlrs this year, due to the exchange rate adjustments of the past 18 months. But he added trade imbalances would also be corrected by commitments from West Germany and Japan to stimulate their economies and by U.S. efforts to cut the budget deficit and enhance U.S. competitiveness. He also said some newly industrialized countries should let their currencies appreciate."

"bank of france buys dollars, sells yen - dealers",money-fx dlr,"The Bank of France intervened on the market to buy dollars and sell yen to support the U.S. Currency, dealers said. A major French bank said it acted for the central bank in buying between five and 15 mln dlrs against yen. A dealer at another bank said his bank had been asked to publicise the intervention, to send a clear signal to the markets that central banks were acting in concert to maintain the exchange rates agreed to be appropriate at last month's meeting of the Group of Five and Canada in Paris. The dollar was being quoted at 6.0950/70 francs in early afternoon dealings after a fix of 6.09425 francs. The major French bank said it sold yen at a rate of 149.28 against the dollar. The U.S. Currency was subsequently being quoted at 149.25/35. The Bank of Japan was reported in the market overnight to bolster the credibility of the Paris accord following several days of pressure against the dollar. Pressure developed after U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker repeated earlier statements that the Reagan administration had no targets for the dollar, apparently undermining the assumption that the agreement in Paris had fixed broad fluctuation ranges for major currencies. Baker later said his remark had been misinterpreted."

Despite the figures, the budget forecast of about 1.75 pct annual growth in employment would be met, Keating said. Unemployment is currently at 8.2 pct of the workforce. ""This government is dragging Australia through a trading holocaust the kind of which we have not seen since the Second World War,"" Keating said. ""We are not pushing this place into a recession.

dollar/yen intervention responds to pressure,money-fx dlr yen,"The Bank of France intervened to buy small amounts of dollars and sell yen in Paris today to stabilise the exchange rates agreed at last month's meeting of Finance Ministers of the Group of Five and Canada, foreign exchange dealers said. But they said recent central bank intervention in the foreign exchange markets appeared to be a limited reaction to temporary pressures rather than a major defence operation. A Bank of France spokesman declined all comment but sources close to the central bank said it had also intervened yesterday. Dealers said the earlier intervention was in concert with the Bundesbank and Bank of Japan. The sources said the French central bank could have been in the market again today in two-way operations, not necessarily on its own account, but to counter short-term pressures arising from the end of the Japanese financial year on March 31. One major French bank said it bought between five and 15 mln dlrs for the central bank and sold yen at 149.28 to the dollar. Another bank said it had been asked by the Bank of France to say it was in the market, a departure from the central bank's usual insistence on confidentiality. But other banks said they had seen no sign of intervention, which they said appeared to be on a very limited scale. ""Even if 10 banks were buying five to 15 mln dlrs, you would still be talking of a small overall amount,"" said one dealer. Recent intervention by the Bank of Japan appeared mainly to have been required to meet year-end window dressing demand for yen. ""This is a specific short term phenomenon rather than a wider trend,"" the dealer said. Operators have been extremely cautious about testing the dollar's trading ranges against the West German mark and Japanese yen. These ranges were set in February's stabilisation agreement reached here by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker and the Finance Ministers of Japan, Germany, France, Britain and Canada. But speculative pressures started to build again this week after Baker was quoted on British television at the weekend as repeating earlier statements that Washington had no target for the dollar. Baker yesterday moved to defuse speculation he was talking the dollar down, telling a Cable News Network interviewer and a Senate committee he stood by the Paris agreement. Foreign exchange markets had been misreading his comments, he said."

Mulford also said that OECD nations need to grow an average three pct to help resolve the international debt crisis.

bp <bp> does not plan to hike standard <srd> bid,acq crude,"British Petroleum Co Plc does not intend to raise the price of its planned 70 dlr per share offer for the publicly held 45 pct of Standard Oil Co, BP Managing Director David Simon said. ""We don't seen this as any progressive bidding game,"" he told reporters at a news conference. BP now owns 55 pct of Standard's stock. Simon said BP had carefully considered the amount of its planned bid and he quoted an oil analyst, whom he would not identify, as saying BP's careful evaluation means the company is not going to raise its offer. ""I think that (an increase) would be totally wrong. I think the price is very fair and it is much to early to speculate about ligigation,"" he said. ""Let's wait and see how the offer runs."" Another official declined to speculate under what circumstances BP might raise its bid. The BP official said the 70 dlrs a share offer is 7.2 times Standard's 1986 cash flow and 56 pct above an independent evaluation of the company's assets, including the value of its oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves. He said the price Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD> <SC> paid for publicly held Shell Oil Co shares in 1985 was 5.1 times cash flow. The BP official also said the 70 dlr bid is a 40 pct premium over Standard's stock price over the past year. BP Group Treasurer Rodney Chase said more than half to as much as two-third's of the 7.4 billion dlrs BP needs for its offer will come from existing sources. The rest will be financed by new debt. BP will draw in cash from its operating companies around the world and is also arranging a five billion dlr line of credit, he explained. The company's debt to equity ratio will rise 11 or 12 percentage points from the current 33 pct if the offer is completed, Chase said. But the ratio will be back below 40 pct within 12 months, he added. Chase also said 50 to 60 pct of Standard Oil's publicly held shares are held by financial institutions. Simon said Standard's board was informed of the offer on March nine and has been considering it since that time. He said BP does not expect any regulatory problems that would delay completion of the acquisition. ""We have informed Washington of our intentions and we've already been an integral part of ownership of U.S. oil reserves,"" he pointed out. Simon said there is a good chance that current world oil prices of about 18 dlrs a barrel could be maintained, and that the more stable market is due mostly to changes in policy in Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members to control oil production. ""We think there are signals that current conditions are more favorable than they have been for sometime,"" Simon said. ""We have hopes for greater stability, but we do not see prices going much higher,"" he added."

""Clearly, they've not been implemented yet... No one expects implementation within a week or two,"" he said. Earlier today, U.S. Treasury assistant secretary told a Senate banking subcommittee that he did not believe that West Germany and Japan have yet carried out their international responsibilities."

""I would concede that, since the Louvre Accord, we are acting as if we are in something,"" Leigh-Pemberton said. ""The Louvre and Plaza accords show there is a very effective role for the (Group of) seven central banks to operate together"" towards stabilising exchange rates,"" Leigh-Pemberton said. He did not mention this week's intervention by central banks to support the dollar, after markets decided to test the accord. Leigh-Pemberton said that ""the effectiveness of this (cooperation) is actually larger than many of us had thought in the pre-Plaza days"" before September 1985. He did not indicate what exchange rate levels were broadly sought by the six nations, and noted that ""we are more effective in our agreement if we can leave the markets guessing."" He did not indicate what exchange rate levels were broadly sought by the six nations, and noted that ""we are more effective in our agreement if we can leave the markets guessing."" Leigh-Pemberton said that, in principle, the Bank of England favoured full EMS membership for sterling, provided such a move did not endanger U.K. Anti-inflation monetary policy. Asked whether he wanted to see U.K. Interest rates lower, he said ""the two half point cuts (this month in banks' base lending rates) have been appropriate up until now."" Leigh-Pemberton said he preferred a ""cautious step-by-step approach"" to reducing short term interest rates, not least because ""we have a potential problem with inflation."" Underlying U.K. Inflation was currently around 4.0 pct, ""one of the highest"" among industrialised nations, he added. Leigh-Pemberton said the Bank of England had not wanted base rates to fall before the unveiling of the 1987/88 budget on March 17, but he said pressure from financial markets for such a move had proved irresistible. Base rates are now at 10 pct. Regarding sterling's relationship with oil, Leigh-Pemberton said that the pound could be seen being undervalued overall. He said the current oil price of some 18 dlrs a barrel might suggest a level of 74 on the Bank of England's sterling index, when compared with the index's level before oil prices dropped from around the 30 dlr level. The index, base 1975, closed here today at 72.1, unchanged from the previous close."
usx <x> says talks ended with british petroleum,acq crude,"USX Corp chairman David Roderick said the company had ended talks with British Petroleum Co Plc <BP> about the possible sale of some energy assets and said USX has no immediate restructuring plans for its oil businesses. ""We have terminated our discussions,"" Roderick told Reuters after a speech to the Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association here. He said USX was not conducting talks with any other possible buyer of its energy assets. Earlier today, BP said it planned to offer 70 dlrs per share for the Standard Oil Co's <SRD> publicly held stock. USX said in December the company had held formal discussions with BP about the potential sale of some of its overseas oil assets and USX had received expressions of interest from a half dozen other oil companies. Roderick, in response to a question, said USX had no immediate plans to restructure its Marathon Oil Co, or Texas Oil and Gas Corp. He said USX also did not plan to sell any of its 49 pct interest in the giant Yates Field in west Texas. ""We want to maintain our production in the Yates Field during these difficult times,"" Roderick added. In response to a question, Roderick also said he did not know whether Australian investor Robert Holmes a Court was accumulating USX stock. In recent days, traders have suggested Holmes a Court was buying additional shares. Roderick said Carl Ichan, who terminated an eight billion dlr hostile takeover plan for USX in January, continued to hold a sizable interest in the company. ""Mr. Ichan still apparently has 11.4 pct. He hasn't bought any more stock or sold any,"" Roderick said. ""He's a very satisfied shareholder right now. I talk with him monthly."" In his speech, Roderick predicted the fall in the value of the dollar would set the stage for the U.S. to solve its trade deficit problem which totaled 170 billion dlrs in 1986. ""I expect by the early 1990s the U.S. will be running a net trade surplus,"" Roderick said. ""I think the worst is over and we can look forward to stability and upward movement ahead."" However, the USX chairman warned that European trading partners may resist the turn in the U.S. trade deficit. ""Some economic discomfort must be transferred from the United States to our friends, trading partners and allies."""

Total corn commitments for the 1986/87 season total 1,015,800 tonnes, the department said."
france will fight ec farm proposals - minister,grain sugar livestock carcass,"French Agricultural Minister Francois Guillaume warned that France would flatly reject proposed reforms of the European Community, EC, cereals, sugar and oilseeds sectors, which he said would disrupt these markets. The EC Commission's proposals to shorten the intervention period and lower monthly premiums for cereals and increase the financial burden on the sugar producers will also result in lower real prices for producers, he told farmers here. ""I give you my word that France, while it will not reject technical adjustments or serious discussion, will simply reply in the negative to these bad reforms,"" Guillaume told the annual conference of the country's major farm union, FNSEA (Federation Nationale des Syndicats Dexploitants Agricoles). Community agricultural ministers are due to meet again Monday to try and agree a package of reforms to curb spiralling EC output and fix farm prices for 1987/88. Relations between the government and farmers have become strained in France in recent months. There have been sporadic but frequent demonstrations by farmers protesting over sharp falls in meat and pork prices and further cutbacks in Community milk output. But Guillaume's warning that he would reject reorganisation of the EC cereal and sugar markets -- France being a major producer of both crops -- won him warm applause from the FNSEA's farmers. His pledge to fight the EC proposals and push for the complete dismantling of the system of cross border taxes designed to smooth out currency differences known as Monetary Compensatory Amounts, MCA's, however, are unlikely to avoid further protests by producers. Farm leader Raymond Lacombe said the union planned to go ahead with a series of major protests both in France and abroad against the EC Commission's proposals to overhaul the farm sector. ""The Minister's proposals back up our determination to organise union action in the coming weeks,"" he told reporters, adding that this could also act in Guillaume's favour on a ministerial level. Guillaume was head of the FNSEA for many years before being appointed farm minister last spring. Lacombe refused to say whether the farmers felt that Guillaume was doing a good job as farm minister. There have been certain advances on cutting production costs, reducing fiscal costs and awarding drought aid, but there are still areas where more could be done such as on farmers' indebtedness, he said. Guillaume told the conference the government will make available 2.4 billion francs (396 mln dlrs) to help producers reduce milk output and to encourage older farmers to retire. The government has already announced financial aid for the milk sector and it was not clear how much of the package announced today was new aid, Lacombe said."
"italian 1986 gdp up 2.7 pct, unemployment rises",gnp jobs,"Extracts from a report by Italy's Budget Ministry on the country's economic development in 1986 showed gross domestic product (GDP) 2.7 pct higher in real terms than in 1985 but a rise in unemployment. GDP calculated at 1980 prices rose to 434,682 billion lire last year from 423,064 billion in 1985. On a current prices basis, GDP was up 11 pct, totalling 894,362 billion lire in 1986 against 805,754 billion in 1985. But growth was insufficient to prevent a rise in unemployment to 11.1 pct last year from 10.3 pct in 1985, the ministry said. The report said falling oil prices and the depreciation of the dollar during 1986 had favoured oil-importing countries such as Italy. These factors helped Italy cut inflation to an average 6.3 pct in 1986, down from 9.3 pct in 1985. They also helped a major improvement in the trade balance. On the basis of data recently recalculated by the national statistics institute Istat, Italy had a trade deficit in 1986 of 3,722 billion lire, the report said. This slightly revises a previous deficit figure of 3,717 billion issued by Istat and compares with a negative balance of 23,085 billion for 1985."

bp <bp> may have to raise bid -  analysts,acq crude,"British Petroleum Co PLC may have to raise its planned 70 dlrs a share tender offer for the publicly traded shares of Standard Oil Co <SRD>, analysts said. ""There's a lot of speculation here that someway or other they would be forced to come up with another bid,"" said Rosario Ilaqua of L.F. Rothschild. And despite BP managing director David Simon's denial today that BP would raise the offer, the analysts said that remained a distinct possibility. Analysts said they base their thinking on Royal Dutch/Shell Group's <RD> <SC> bid to buy the outstanding stake of Shell Oil Co in 1984 and 1985. Royal Dutch/Shell eventually raised its initial 55 dlrs a share offer to 60 dlrs a share, after lawsuits by minority shareholders. ""I think they're going to have to go a little higher eventually, just as Royal Dutch/Shell had to go a little higher for the Shell Oil minority shares,"" Bruce Lazier of Prescott Ball and Turben said. He estimated a price of 75 dlrs a share. Royal Dutch/Shell offered 55 dlrs a share for the 30.5 pct of Shell Oil it did not already own in January of 1984. After objections from minority shareholders about the price, Royal Dutch/Shell raised its bid and began a 58 dlrs a share tender offer in April 1984. But shareholders sued and a court blocked completion of the offer. After months of wrangling over the worth of Shell Oil, Royal Dutch/Shell agreed to another two dlrs increase. It ended up paying 5.67 billion dlrs for the outstanding Shell Oil stake, a significant premium to its original bid of about 5.2 billion dlrs. The analysts made their comments before Simon's remarks at a BP press conference in New York this afternoon. Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc told clients this morning that a sweetened offer was possible. The analyst said the bid could be raised by two dlrs a share. Analysts do not expect regulatory hurdles because of the Royal Dutch/Shell group precedent. But there may be shareholder lawsuits for the same reason, they said. Goldman Sachs and Co, BP's investment advisor, advised the Shell Oil board in 1984 and 1985."
no grain shipments to the ussr -- usda,grain corn wheat oilseed soybean,"There were no shipments of U.S. grain or soybeans to the Soviet Union in the week ended March 19, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department's latest Export Sales report. The USSR has purchased 2.40 mln tonnes of U.S. corn for delivery in the fourth year of the U.S.-USSR grain agreement. Total shipments in the third year of the U.S.-USSR grains agreement, which ended September 30, amounted to 152,600 tonnes of wheat, 6,808,100 tonnes of corn and 1,518,700 tonnes of soybeans."
usda comments on export sales report,grain corn wheat oilseed soybean meal-feed veg-oil soy-oil sorghum barley,"Corn sales of 2,806,300 tonnes in the week ended March 19 were the highest level since mid-November, 1979, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. The department said the USSR dominated the week's activity with purchases of 1.4 mln tonnes (which were earlier reported under the daily reporting system). Other large increaes were posted for Japan and unknown destinations, it said. Taiwan purchased 296,300 tonnes for the 1986/87 season and 170,000 tonnes for the 1987/88 season, it said. Wheat sales of 317,200 tonnes for the current season and 125,000 tonnes for the 1987/88 season were down about one-third from the preceding week and the four-week average. Wheat sales to China of 60,000 tonnes were switched from 1986/87 to the 1987/88 season, it noted. Soybean sales of 483,100 tonnes were 11 pct above the prior week and two-thirds above the four-week average. Japan, the Netherlands, Mexico and Portugal were the main buyers, the department said. Soybean cake and meal sales of 289,400 tonnes were two-thirds above the previous week and the largest of the marketing year, with Venezuela the dominant purchaser. Sales activity in soybean oil resulted in decreases of 4,400 tonnes, as reductions for unknown destinations more than offset increases for Canada, the Dominican Republic and Panama, the department said. Cotton sales of 57,900 running bales -- 43,800 bales for the current year and 14,200 bales for the 1987/88 season -- were off 25 pct from the previous week and 50 pct from the four-week average. Turkey, Thailand, South Korea and Canada were the major buyers for the current season, while Thailand, Britain and Japan were the major purchasers from the upcoming season, the department said. Sorghum sales of 178,800 tonnes were two-thirds above the prior week and 75 pct over the four-week average. Venezuela was the leading buyer it said. Sales of 41,800 tonnes of barley were 10 times the previous week and 10 pct greater than the four-week average. Israel, Cyprus and Saudi Arabia were the main buyers, it said."
standard oil <srd> sees boost in 1987 cash flow,acq crude nat-gas,"Standard Oil Co expects the sale of assets and federal tax refunds resulting from last year's loss to add about one billion dlrs to its normal cash flows from operations in 1987, its annual report said. Last year, the report noted, the cash flow from operations dropped to 1.8 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion dlrs in 1985 and 3.2 billion dlrs in 1984 due principally to lower oil prices. The report, prepared before British Petroleum Co Plc <BP> disclosed plans to seek the rest of Standard's stock, put 1987 capital spending at 1.6 billion dlrs, down from the 1.7 billion dlrs projected in January. Standard's capital spending totaled 1.77 billion dlrs in 1986. The report showed a decline in proven oil reserves to 2.41 billion barrels at the end of 1986 from 2.65 billion barrels a year earlier as discoveries and other additions dropped to 11.4 mln barrels last year from 23.2 mln in 1985. But it said gas reeserves rose to 7.31 trillion cubic feet from 7.22 trillion at the end of 1985 despite a 30.9 mln cubic feet downward revision in previous reserve estimates during 1986. Discoveries and other additions totaled 200.5 billion cubic feet last year, up from 175.9 billion in 1985, it added. Standard said both oil and gas production increased last year -- to 726,600 barrels per day from 719,700 barrels the previous day and to 154.4 mln cubic feet daily from 10.1 mln in 1985. But the average sales price of both dropped -- to 13.83 dlrs per barrel from 26.43 dlrs for oil in 1985 and to 1.49 dlrs per thousand cubic feet from 2.18 dlrs a year earlier. Standard said its refined product sales also rose last year, to 644,500 barrels per day from 604,200 barrels daily in 1985."

oil executives see gradual rise in prices,crude nat-gas,"Top executives with Tenneco Corp <TGT> and Sabine Corp <SAB> said they expected world oil prices to gradually increase over the next two years as U.S. reliance on imports of oil from the Middle East grows. ""I believe we have bottomed out and can look forward to a trend of gradually increasing prices,"" C.W. Nance, president of Tenneco Oil Exploration and Production, told a meeting of the Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association. Nance predicted that by 1990, the Organization of Producing and Exporting Countries would be producing at the rate of 80 pct of capacity. The gain will come largely through increased imports to the United States, he said. ""They will be able to raise the price again but I do not think they will raise it as much as they did in 1979,"" Nance said. He did not say how much of a price hike he expected. Andrew Shoup, chairman of Dallas-based Sabine, predicted that world oil prices would increase from a range of 15 to 20 dlrs a barrel in 1987 to a range of 17 to 22 dlrs a barrel in 1988. Natural gas prices, Shoup said, should similarly climb from a range of 1.30 to 1.70 dlrs per mcf this year to between 1.50 and 1.90 dlrs per mcf in 1988. ""Fuel switching could help us as much as five pct in increased demand,"" Shoup said, referring to the gas industry's outlook for 1987. Repeal of the Fuel Use Act, a federal law prohibiting the use of natural gas in new manufacturing plants and utilities, could increase demand for gas by as much as 15 pct, he said. Tenneco's Nance also said that some U.S. cities may experience peak day shortages in natural gas supplies next winter because of the industry's reduced deliverability. Tenneco's gas deliverability, for example, dropped by 20 pct during 1986, he said. ""This does not mean the gas bubble is gone,"" Nance said. ""We believe gas prices have bottomed out. The real question is how broad the valley is -- is it one year, two years or three years before we start to climb out?"" J.C. Walter of <Walter Oil and Gas Corp>, said the recent improvement in oil prices was not enough for independent producers to begin new onshore drilling projects. ""If crude oil stays below 20 dlrs a barrel and 1.50 dlr per mcf for natural gas prevails, the prospects for onshore exploration at deeper depths in the Texas Gulf Coast by independents in the 1990s are pretty dismal,"" Walter said. He suggested that some independents may instead turn to exploration in shallow federal offshore leases. Farm-out agreements, cheap rig rates and less competition have held finding costs in those areas to five or six dlrs a barrel, Walter said."
fed data indicate policy likely to stay on hold,money-supply interest,"Federal Reserve data released today indicate that there has been no policy change in recent weeks and that none is likely at next week's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, economists said. ""The Fed continues to be accommodative in its provision of reserves, indicating that there has been no policy shift since the beginning of this year,"" said Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank. ""These numbers and other things suggest the FOMC will not change policy,"" said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co. ""The Fed is sitting fairly pretty now. There's no real reason for it to change policy,"" said Joseph Liro of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc. Liro said the economy is showing moderate growth and does not require immediate policy easing and the money aggregates may well end March at the bottom of their target ranges. All of the economists agreed that the Fed's major concern now is recent weakness in the dollar which early this week was heavily supported by central banks. They said fear of hurting the dollar will cause the Fed to be cautious in lowering interest rates further. Numbers released by the Fed today were all in line with expectations and similar to the data for most of this year. The Fed said that banks' net free reserves averaged 603 mln dlrs in the two-week statement period that ended on Wednesday versus 749 mln dlrs in the previous period. In the single week to Wednesday, banks' borrowings at the discount window, less extended credits, averaged 302 mln dlrs compared with 228 mln dlrs in the first week of the statement period. Meanwhile the Federal funds rate average edged up to 6.14 pct from 6.08 pct. The Fed's failure to add reserves in the market on Tuesday and Wednesday surprised some, but economists said the data released today suggest it had no real need to add reserves. The Fed's absence may be explained by the lack of any pressing need for it to supply reserves and by a desire to boost borrowings in the second week of the statement period to meet its borrowings target, said Liro of Warburg. Liro said the Fed probably is shooting for a two-week borrowings average of 300-325 mln dlrs. The borrowings actually averaged 265 mln dlrs in the latest statement period and that was up from 191 mln dlrs in the prior period. Brusca of Nikko agreed that the Fed probably is aiming for two-week average discount window borrowings of around 300 mln dlrs. He said that would correspond to a Federal funds rate of around 6.10 pct. It is nearly impossible for the Fed to hit any borrowings target since the demand for excess reserves is erratic, said Wells Fargo's Nathan. He said the Fed is focusing instead on the funds rate and is trying to keep it roughly within a six to 6-1/4 pct band. Upward funds rate pressure and a big reserve-adding need are anticipated for the statement period that began today. More Brusca believes the Fed will have to add 3.5 to four billion dlrs a day in reserves in this statement period. Liro puts the add need at around 3.9 billion dlrs. To partly address this requirement, many expect the Fed to add permanent reserves with effect next Thursday by offering to buy all maturities of Treasury bills on Wednesday. A similar coupon ""pass"" may be required later. There will be a greater demand for funds in this statement period because it includes the close of the quarter. Further upward pressure on the Federal funds rate may come from window dressing demand as the Japanese fiscal year ends on March 31."
india steps up countertrade deals to cut trade gap,trade grain wheat tea coffee iron-steel crude,"India is searching for non-communist countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and conserve foreign exchange. Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products, chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters. Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in 1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC). ""The two state trading corporations are free to use their buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian exports,"" a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that private firms are excluded from countertrading. One trade source said India has targetted countries that depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign imports. However, countertrade deals still make up only a small part of India's total trading and are likely to account for less than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade during the nine months ended December, the sources said. Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65 billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March, against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show. However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said. Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87, against three billion in 1985/86. Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to help narrow the country's large trade deficit, is still insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia, Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said. The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96 billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billion in the current fiscal year. But the push to include non-communist countries in countertrade is also due to other factors, including the slow growth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule, shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said. One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting countertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were made discreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannot officially support bartering. The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron ore exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails. ""MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause that preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind for goods and services sold to India,"" a trade official said, adding that the policy remains flexible. ""We also take into account other factors such as prices at which the goods and services are offered to India,"" the trade official said. Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign companies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigs and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance if they bought Indian goods or services in return, the trade sources said. Illustrating the point, the official said a South Korean firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln dlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission. In return, the South Koreans gave a verbal assurance to buy Indian goods worth 10 pct of the contract, against the 25 pct sought by New Delhi, the trade official said. ""We selected the Korean firm because its bid was the lowest,"" he added. Countertrade is helping African countries short of foreign currency to import goods. India has signed a trade protocol to buy up to 15,000 tonnes of asbestos fibre from Zimbabwe in exchange for Indian goods, including jute bags and cars. But despite India's new drive, countertrade has some inherent problems, they added. ""It is not always easy to meet the basic requirement that the trade should always be balanced,"" one trade source said. ""The other problem is it is often difficult to supply or buy commodities which the other party wants."" Another added, ""Barter is also restrictive. We look upon it as a temporary measure to get over the current balance of payments difficulty. ""This is why countertrade has not been made a law in India. It does not even figure in the country's foreign trade policy."""
japan seamless pipe makers to form export cartel,iron-steel trade,"Four major Japanese steelmakers plan to form a seamless pipe export cartel for markets other than the U.S. And the European Community for a year from April to keep prices above output costs, company officials involved said. The companies are Nippon steel Corp <NSTC.T>, Sumitomo Metal Industries Ltd <SMIT.T>, Nippon Kokan KK <NKKT.T> and Kawasaki Steel Corp <KAWS.T>, which together account for some 95 pct of Japan's total seamless pipe exports. The firms will apply to form the cartel to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry today and approval is expected later this month, the officials said. Under the plan, the four companies will set floor prices for exports as prices have fallen sharply due to the yen's appreciation against the dollar, reduced world demand caused by lower oil prices and excess domestic capacity which resulted in price-cutting competition, the officials said. In calendar 1986, seamless pipe exports fell to 2.34 mln tonnes from 2.99 mln in 1985 and 3.12 mln in 1981. The officials declined to give any idea of floor prices, saying it depends partly on volume, but industry sources estimate average export prices would rise by around 20 pct to some 800 dlrs a tonne."

The long-term capital account deficit widened to 11.40 billion dlrs from 8.06 billion a year ago, but it narrowed from 12.32 billion in January, the Ministry said. Japan's February exports rose to 16.74 billion dlrs from 14.89 billion in February 1986 and from 14.65 billion in January, the Ministry said. Imports fell to 8.61 billion from 10.12 billion a year earlier and 8.94 billion in January. The invisible trade deficit fell to 617 mln dlrs in February from 693 mln a year earlier, but was up from a 527 mln deficit in January. Figures do not tally exactly because of rounding. Transfer payments narrowed to a 140 mln dlr deficit last month from a 185 mln deficit a year earlier and a 225 mln deficit in January. The basic balance of payments deficit in February fell to 4.02 billion dlrs from 4.17 billion in February 1986 and 7.37 billion in January. Short-term capital account payments swung to a 1.28 billion dlr deficit in February from a 1.60 billion surplus a year earlier and a 1.44 billion dlr surplus in January. Errors and omissions were 2.65 billion dlrs in surplus, compared with a 1.27 billion surplus a year earlier and a 1.10 billion deficit in January. The overall balance of payments deficit rose to 2.65 billion dlrs from 1.30 billion a year earlier but was down from 7.04 billion in January. The seasonally adjusted trade surplus fell to 9.16 billion dlrs in February from the record 9.58 billion in January, the Ministry said. The seasonally adjusted current account surplus also dropped to 8.4 billion dlrs in February from the record 8.83 billion set in January."

south african maize estimate called conservative,grain corn,"The South African government's maize production estimate of 7.8 mln tonnes for the current year is ""rather too conservative,"" leading grain and produce merchants Kahn and Kahn Pty Ltd said. The company, in a detailed report, estimated the harvest as high as 8.3 mln tonnes and said if this forecast is met the ostensible surplus for export will be approximately 2.25 mln tonnes. ""This paradoxically is creating a problem for the Maize Board,"" Kahn and Kahn said. It said the maize export price currently is depressed and the board is ""probably confronted with the necessity to maintain or slightly increase the internal price of maize again...To offset the ostensible loss which must be faced"" on exporting surplus amounts."
italian 1987 gdp growth forecast at three pct,gnp money-fx,"Italy's gross domestic product (GDP) will grow three pct in real terms this year and 2.7 pct in 1988, said economic information company Data Resources Europe Inc (DRI). Michel Girardin, DRI Europe's senior economist, said at a conference that Italian GDP growth this year ""will be mainly driven by consumption and especially investment."" Girardin said the driving force behind GDP growth next year will shift from domestic demand to exports as a result of expected depreciation of the lira against the major currencies. Italy's budget ministry said yesterday that GDP rose 2.7 pct in real terms in 1986. DRI forecast that inflation, which was an average 6.3 pct in 1986, will be under five pct this year and that interest rates should drop two pct. Girardin said the lira is expected to appreciate 14 pct against the dollar this year following last year's 22 pct appreciation. An expected German mark appreciation against the dollar means that the lira should lose about six pct of its value relative to the German currency, he said. DRI estimates that foreign demand for Italian products should grow by a 3.2 pct this year following last year's 6.2 pct increase."
trade surplus will pose added pressures for japan,trade bop,"Japan today announced another mammoth monthly trade surplus that economists said would be sure to intensify already mounting pressure on the country for action. ""The world has every reason to be furious with Japan for not moving more quickly,"" Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd economist Eric Rasmussen said. The Finance Ministry said today that the trade surplus soared to 8.14 billion dlrs in February from 5.7 billion in January and 4.77 billion a year ago. The current account surplus, which includes trade in services as well as goods, climbed to 7.38 billion dlrs last month from 4.95 billion in January and 3.89 billion a year ago. After being adjusted for seasonal fluctuations, the figures look a bit better, but not much. On that basis, the trade surplus declined slightly in February to 9.16 billion dlrs from a record 9.58 billion in January. ""In the medium term we expect this modest improvement to continue but the pace of progress may be too slow to ward off further protectionism or further yen strength,"" said William Stirling, economist at Merrill Lynch Japan Inc. A strong yen would make Japanese goods more expensive on world markets while making imports into the country cheaper. ""On a seasonally adjusted basis, we appear to be making some progress on getting exports down,"" Jardine's Rasmussen said. But imports do not seem to be picking up much because the Japanese economy remains sluggish, he said. Finance Ministry officials blamed last month's slower import growth on a decline in oil imports as refiners worked off stocks they had built up in January. The officials took comfort from a decline in the volume of exports last month, after an unexpected year-on-year increase in January. This means the effects of the two-year rise of the yen against the U.S. Dollar are finally beginning to have an impact on exports, they said. But economists warned that may not be soon enough for Japan's trading partners."
economic spotlight - dutch exchange rate policy,money-fx dfl,"Recent slackness on Dutch capital markets has led some bankers to question the Central Bank's policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the West German mark and to ask for more flexiblility in exchange rate policy. While agreeing with the Bank's commitment to defend the guilder strongly, some bankers want the Bank to make more use of the range within which the guilder and the mark can fluctuate against each other in the European Monetary System (EMS). Roelof Nelissen, chairman of Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV (Amro) said the Central Bank's policy was overcautious. ""I would like to suggest that the Bank use more freely the range given to the guilder in the EMS,"" Nelissen said at the presentation of Amro's 1986 annual report last week. Within the EMS, the mark is allowed to fluctuate against the guilder between 110.1675 and 115.235 guilders per 100. The Central Bank maintains a stricter policy and tries to keep the mark below the 113.00 guilders per 100. It regards a stable exchange rate as its main target, using interest rate policies to influence the exchange rate. The preference of exchange rate goals above interest rate aims goes almost undisputed in the Netherlands. Critics say the Bank keeps the reins unnecessarily short. Rabobank Nederland said in its latest economic bulletin: ""By maintaining the 113.00 limit, the Central Bank raises the expectation it will always intervene above that level. If it suddenly needs more flexibility it will find it very hard to obtain."" Amro's Nelissen said relatively small changes in interest rates and exchange rates could cause substantial flows of securities business and sharp fluctuations on the Dutch capital market. Large interest rate changes were often needed to bring about small changes in the guilder/mark exchange rate, he added. Unlike Amro, Algemene Bank Nederland NV (ABN) says this is a price the Dutch have to pay. It fully agrees with the Central Bank's policy, director-general Julien Geertsema told Reuters, noting a 1983 decision not to revalue the guilder fully with the mark in the EMS hurt confidence in the Dutch currency. ""It is a pity we need such a wide interest rate difference between West Germany to maintain the exchange rate,"" he added. Interest rate differentials between West Germany and the Netherlands are the main factors that trigger capital flows between the two countries, as the economic performance of the two does not differ much, economists said. Data on 1986 capital flows between West Germany and the Netherlands have not yet been released, but in 1985 they accounted for only 10 pct of total trade flows between the two countries, put at 110 billion guilders for 1986 by the Dutch-German Chamber of Commerce earlier this month. Economists say capital flows are more sensitive to interest and exchange rates. West Germany is the Netherlands' largest single trading partner, taking 28 pct of Dutch exports and providing 26 pct of imports in the last quarter of 1986, Central Bureau of Statistics figures show. At the moment, the rates for three month euromark deposits trade around 4.0 pct while the same deposits in guilders have a rate of around 5-7/16 pct. Amro bank argues that the Dutch real interest rate will even rise further because of expectations of deflation here in 1987, contrasting with slight inflation in West Germany. In the Netherlands, the cost of living is expected to decrease by 1.5 pct at a GNP growth rate of two pct, the Dutch Central Planning Agency said in its 1987 forecast last month. German GNP is seen rising by two to 2.5 pct, but with inflation between zero and 1.0 pct, according to most German forecasts. But despite this upward push on real Dutch rates, money dealers do not expect the Central Bank to cut official rates independently without prior moves by the Bundesbank. Following the West German interest rate cuts on January 22, the Dutch Central Bank did not lower its rates but set a 0.5 pct lower tariff for special advances and abandoned its credit surcharge. Most traders were surprised by this move as they had expected the Bank to follow suit unconditionally, they said. The Bank said it lowered the rate with the largest impact on the money market as far as the exchange rate permitted. While not entirely unsympathetic to critics of its policies, the Central Bank keeps its grip firm and the range narrow. ""The European Monetary System is not only a relationship between the guilder and the mark. Many times widening of the margin between the two would implicate we have to buy or sell large amounts of a third currency,"" Central Bank vice-director Jan-Hendrik Du Marchie Sarvaas said. ""If we allowed the guilder to become a little cheaper, the markets would start to believe it was weak. We don't want that. We want to make clear that the guilder is just as strong as the mark,"" he said."
bank of japan intervenes to stem dollar fall,money-fx dlr,"The Bank of Japan intervened in the market to keep the dollar above 149 yen but the unit was under strong selling pressure by an investment trust, dealers said. The central bank stepped into the market when the dollar fell towards 149.00 yen, but a trust bank aggressively sold dollars to hedge currency risks, and the Bank intervened again at 149.00, they said. The trust bank apparently changed its earlier view that the dollar would rise and started selling relatively large amounts of dollars, pushing the unit down to 148.80 at one point, brokers said. One dealer estimated that the Bank bought 400 mln to 500 mln dlrs as it tried to keep the U.S. Currency above 149 yen."

ec extends parts of free food for poor scheme,carcass sugar,"A scheme to distribute surplus food free to the poor in the European Community (EC), which was due to expire next Tuesday, will be partially extended for a further month, an EC Commission spokesman said. He added the executive Commission has not yet decided whether the scheme should become a permanent feature of the EC's struggle to find a use for its massive stocks of farm produce. Almost 60,000 tonnes of cereals, sugar, beef, butter and other food have been authorised for distribution under an operation sanctioned by EC farm ministers on January 20 in which charities act as executive Commission agents. The original idea was to help the needy survive this year's unusually cold European winter. The spokesman said the Commission was extending the scheme fully in Greece, which has recently been hit by unseasonal snowstorms, for the month of April. Other EC countries would be authorised to use stocks of food for which they have already applied under the scheme up to April 30. The spokesman said this would enable distribution of flour, semolina, sugar and olive oil at a relatively high rate next month. He said the Commission, which has powers to continue most aspects of the scheme without consulting ministers further, will be considering soon whether it should be made permanent. Cost, which has already reached around 65 mln European currency units, would be a major consideration. End-January stocks included 1.28 mln tonnes of butter, 520,000 tonnes of beef and over 10 mln tonnes of cereals."

The long-term capital account deficit widened to 11.40 billion dlrs from 8.06 billion a year ago, but it narrowed from 12.32 billion in January, the Ministry said. Japan's February exports rose to 16.74 billion dlrs from 14.89 billion in February 1986 and from 14.65 billion in January, the Ministry said. Imports fell to 8.61 billion from 10.12 billion a year earlier and 8.94 billion in January. The invisible trade deficit fell to 617 mln dlrs in February from 693 mln a year earlier, but was up from a 527 mln deficit in January. Figures do not tally exactly because of rounding. Transfer payments narrowed to a 140 mln dlr deficit last month from a 185 mln deficit a year earlier and a 225 mln deficit in January. The basic balance of payments deficit in February fell to 4.02 billion dlrs from 4.17 billion in February 1986 and 7.37 billion in January.

swiss national bank says it bought dollars,money-fx dlr,"The Swiss National Bank bought dollars against yen today, a spokesman for the bank said. He declined to say how many dollars the bank bought or when precisely it intervened. Swiss foreign exchange dealers described the National Bank's purchases as modest, perhaps amounting to no more than 20 or 30 mln dlrs. The Bank of France, which was reported buying dollars against the yen in Paris, had made inquiries with Swiss banks as well, and the Bundesbank had also intervened. Bank of Japan dollar purchases today were perhaps 1.2 to 1.5 billion dlrs. Dealers said this tended to confirm the market's impression that major industrial countries had agreed at the Paris meeting on an effective floor for the dollar of 148 yen, and the market seemed ready to test it. Commercial clients were also selling dollars against the yen as the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31 drew closer. Today's dealings in spot currencies are booked for March 31. One dealer said he had the feeling Japanese companies had been asked by the Bank of Japan not to sell dollars at this point, but some, while sticking to the letter of that request, were offering dollars forward today, rather than lose out if the dollar fell further. The run on the dollar against the yen came in a market thinned by the absence of many dealers for a Forex Club meeting in Hamburg. Trading was, in fact, rather light against currencies other than the yen, the dollar holding little changed through the day. The market now expected the U.S. Federal Reserve to intervene in support of the dollar. ""But they will probably do it only half-heartedly, so I don't think it will matter too much on rates,"" one dealer said."
papandreou says greeks ready for aggressors,crude ship,"Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou said today that the Greek armed froces were ready to tackle any aggressors following the sailing of a Turkish research vessel and warships towards disputed waters in the Aegean Sea. Papandreou told an emergency cabinet meeting in Athens ""the military readiness of our country is able now to give a very hard lesson if our neighbours (Turkey) were to carry out military actions."" He said the activities of the research vessel could be aimed at partitioning the Aegean. ""The air force, navy and army are in a state of alert,"" General Guven Ergenc, Secretary General of the Turkish General Staff, told a news conference. He said the Turkish research ship Sismik 1, escorted by an unspecified number of warships, would sail into disputed waters in the Aegean Sea tomorrow morning. Ergenc told Reuters later that all leave had been cancelled for members of the armed forces in the Aegean coast area. The Turkish government said yesterday it had licensed the state-owned Turkish Petroleum Corp to explore for oil in international waters around three Greek islands off Turkey. Greece and Turkey have long-standing disputes over areas of the Aegean and the presence of Turkish troops in Cyprus. The latest row erupted when the Greek government said last month that it was taking control of a Canadian-led consortium which was already producing oil off the Greek island of Thassos and would drill in the same area after the takeover. Ergenc told the news conference the alert followed a government decision that Turkey should protect its interests ""because of measures Greece has been taking in the Aegean in violation of international agreements."" Asked how Turkey would react if Greece attacked any of the vessels, he said ""If there is an attack, it is clear what has to be done. An attack on a warship is a cause for war."" But he added ""We are not in a state of war. The measures taken by the military are directed towards protecting our rights."" Greece said yesterday it would defend its national rights in the Aegean and urged Turkey to accept reference of the dispute to the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Yalim Eralp told reporters today this was unacceptable because of preconditions Athens had attached. In Athens, Greek Prime Minister Papandreou said that if the Turkish vessel Sismik 1 began research operations ""we will hinder it, of course not with words, as it cannot be stopped with words."" Greek newspapers said the armed forces were on alert and navy ships had gone to the Aegean. But government spokesman Yannis Roubatis did not confirm the move, saying only ""The Greek fleet is not at its naval base."" Papandreou said that a map issued in Turkey showed 95 pct of the areas proposed for research were on the Greek continental shelf. Papandreou told the U.S. And NATO that if they had a part in orchestrating the present crisis in order to force Greece to negotiate with Turkey, the Greek government would not accept it. Papandreou has maintained in the past that he will not negotiate with Ankara until Turkey recognises Greek rights in the Aegean and withdraws its troops from Cyprus. He said that in the case of war with Turkey it would not be possible for Greece to discuss the future of American military bases here. Asked by reporters if he would close the U.S. Bases in Greece in the event of war, Papandreou replied ""Obviously, and perhaps even before the war."""
india steps up countertrade deals,trade grain wheat coffee tea iron-steel crude,"India is searching for non-communist countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and conserve foreign exchange. Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products, chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters. Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in 1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC). ""The two state trading corporations are free to use their buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian exports,"" a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that private firms are excluded from countertrading. One trade source said India has targetted countries that depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign imports. But countertrade deals still make up only a small part of India's total trading and are likely to account for less than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade during the nine months ended December, the sources said. Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65 billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March, against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show. However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said. Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87."

lower ascs corn prices to affect ten states,grain corn,"The Agriculture Department's widening of Louisiana gulf differentials will affect county posted prices for number two yellow corn in ten states, a USDA official said. All counties in Iowa will be affected, as will counties which use the gulf to price corn in Illinois, Indiana, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, Mississippi, Arkansas, Alabama and Louisiana, said Ron Burgess, Deputy Director of Commodity Operations Division for the USDA. USDA last night notified the grain industry that effective immediately, all gulf differentials used to price interior corn would be widened on a sliding scale basis of four to eight cts, depending on what the differential is. USDA's action was taken to lower excessively high posted county prices for corn caused by high gulf prices. ""We've been following this Louisiana gulf situation for a month, and we don't think it's going to get back in line in any nearby time,"" Burgess said. Burgess said USDA will probably narrow back the gulf differentials when and if Gulf prices recede. ""If we're off the mark now because we're too high, wouldn't we be as much off the mark if we're too low?"" he said. While forecasting more adjustments if Gulf prices fall, Burgess said no other changes in USDA's price system are being planned right now. ""We don't tinker. We don't make changes lightly, and we don't make changes often,"" he said."

drought cuts chinese wheat crop -- usda report,grain wheat,"Drought has resulted in a reduction in China's estimated wheat crop this year to 87.0 mln tonnes, 2.0 mln below last year's harvest, the U.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Peking said in a field report.

After travelling to major wheat producing areas and obtaining more information on the planted area, the total planted area was estimated down 290,000 hectares due to the dry fall, it said. The report said to compensate for the below normal precipitation irrigation has increased as has the use of fertilizer. While there are pockets where irrigation is not possible, most of the wheat crop has access to some water and therefore has emerged from dormancy and is doing well, the report said. It said scattered rain in many parts of China in the past 10 days has improved the situation but information on hail damage in Anhui is incomplete."

south africa gdp up 4.7 pct in 1986 last quarter,gnp reserves,"The South African Reserve Bank, confirming previous estimates, said real gross domestic product in the 1986 fourth quarter grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.7 pct versus 4.6 pct in the third quarter and 1.3 pct in the 1985 final quarter. The bank, in its latest quarterly review, said the nominal growth rate for the year did not quite reach one pct after a 1.5 pct contraction in 1985. But it said when the strengthening of the terms of trade is taken into account, the real GNP in 1986 advanced by 1.5 pct compared with a decrease of 0.5 pct in 1985. GDP is the total value of goods and services produced by an economy but omits income from abroad. GNP includes such payments or outflows. The bank also said there were indications the country's economic recovery was becoming more broadly based. With the exception of commerce all major sectors of the economy contributed to the fourth quarter rise in domestic production. The bank said major increases in foreign reserves were recorded in January, February and the first half of March 1987. Reserves rose by 1.70 billion rand during January and February. Total reserves in 1986 declined by 189 mln rand to 5.70 billion rand and were equivalent to about 14.5 pct of the total annual value of import payments. The current account surplus amounted to 7.20 billion rand in 1986 versus 5.90 mln the previous year. The bank said continuing strength of the current account has allowed foreign reserves to be ""rebuilt to more comfortable levels."" ""This has strengthened the authorities' hands in lending support to the exchange rate of the rand if such action were to be called for,"" the bank said."
nato calls on greece and turkey to avoid force,crude ship,"Greece and Turkey's NATO allies today called on both countries to avoid any action that could aggravate an explosive situation in the Aegean and ""avoid recourse to force at all costs."" After an emergency meeting of NATO ambassadors, a statement was issued saying ""the present situation damages the interests of Greece and Turkey, and of the Alliance as a whole."" Secretary-General Lord Carrington also offered himself as a mediator in the dispute on the Western Alliance's southern flank. The meeting was called after reports that warships of both countries were sailing towards a disputed oil exploration zone of the Aegean. The statement said the tensions in the area had reached a serious level and called on both countries to begin immediate discussions. ""Any intensification would make things worse,"" it added. No attempt was made at the meeting to resolve the complex dispute which was aimed at damage-limitation. Carrington said, ""I am of course anxious to help in any way I can, provided that both Greece and Turkey, and the other allies, wish me to do so."""
talking point/gold,gold money-fx,"The price of gold bullion and share prices of North American gold stocks are benefiting from continued weakness in the U.S. dollar, analysts said. ""There's been a tug of war between the (currency) speculators and the central banks over the U.S. dollar and it looks like the game has gone to the speculators,"" said John Ing at Maison Placements Canada Inc. The dollar remained close to post-World War II lows today against the Japanese yen despite buying by several central banks, including the Federal Reserve, dealers said. A drop in the dollar means uncertainty and gold is the traditional hedge against uncertainty, Ing noted. Another analyst, Richard Cohen at Brown Baldwin Nisker Ltd, noted that ""a lot of foreign investors are holding U.S. dollars. If they see they are losing money, they move back into gold."" A dollar decline also has inflationary implications, Ing said, adding that Maison Placements sees inflation rising to a four pct annual rate from the current level of about three pct. Ing predicts gold will peak at 510 dlrs this year from its current level of about 416 dlrs per ounce. Cohen sees an average price of 425 dlrs, and another analyst, Michael Pickens, at Yorkton Securities, puts the average at 450 dlrs, with a possible spike above 500 dlrs. However, gold stocks in the U.S. and Canada have risen far faster in recent months than the price of the metal itself, causing concern among analysts that a correction lies somewhere in the future. But for now, all analysts say there is no sign the buying pressure is slowing down. ""The stocks have run an incredible way,"" Cohen said. On U.S. markets today, ASA Ltd <ASA> rose 4-1/8 to 61-1/2, Campbell Red Lake Mines <CRK> was up 1-3/8 and Newmont Gold <NGC> increased 1-1/2 to 31-1/4. The Toronto Stock Exchange gold index today was up 268 points at 8067.90. Hemlo Gold gained 1-1/4 at 26-3/4, LAC Minerals was up 1-5/8 at 41, Placer Development rose 1-1/4 at 43-3/8 and Lacana Mining gained 1 at 18. Ing pointed out that the TSE gold index has gained 51 pct since December 31, 1986, while the price of bullion has increased six pct. ""Canadian golds have been the top performing index this year,"" he noted. In the U.S., there is ""too much money chasing too few stocks,"" Pickens said. And many investing institutions such as pension funds and insurance companies still have excess cash, he added. Cohen also noted that today's silver price break through six dlrs an ounce indicates small investors are entering the precious metals market and he expects the ratio between gold and silver prices to narrow."
u.s. energy costs rose in february by 1.9 pct,cpi crude nat-gas heat propane,"Consumer energy costs rose 1.9 pct in February following a sharp rise last month, the Labor Department said. The February increase in the overall energy costs, including petroleum, coal and natural gas, followed a 0.2 pct drop in December and a 3.0 pct rise in January, it said. Energy prices were 12.2 pct below year-ago levels. The department's Consumer Price Index showed that the cost of gasoline rose in February by 4.2 pct, after a 6.6 pct rise in January. Gasoline prices were nonetheless 18.0 pct below their levels as of February 1986. Also, the category including fuel oil, coal and bottled gas rose in February by 3.8 pct, putting it 14.9 pct under the year-ago figure. The index also showed that natural gas and electricity were unchanged last month, but down 3.5 pct from the February 1986 figure, the department said. The index has been updated o reflect 1982-84 consumption patterns; previously, the index was based on 1972-73 patterns."
cold air a threat to some u.s. hard wheat areas,wheat grain,"A cold air mass working its way south from Canada may pose a threat to developing hard red winter wheat in Oklahoma, according to Eugene Krenzler, wheat specialist for the Oklahoma Cooperative Extension. ""There is some threat. Some of the crop is far enough along so that it's probably vulnerable,"" Krenzler said. Accu Weather meteorologist Dale Mohler said cold air moving from the north could put temperatures in the middle 20's fahrenheit as early as tonight, depending on development of a low pressure area over southeast Colorado which could stall the system. If impeded by the low-pressure area, the cold air could hit Oklahoma and Texas as late as Monday morning. Temperatures could stay in the mid-20's for up to eight hours, Mohler said. Krenzler said less than 10 pct of the Oklahoma wheat crop has advanced to boot stage. The closer to that stage the more vulnerable the head of the wheat is to cold weather, he said. ""We can handle probably an hour or so down to 25 or 26 degrees (fahrenheit),"" Krenzler said, ""as long as we don't have a lot of wind."" ""If we do get six hours down below 25 degrees I'd say we have a good chance of significant damage to the heads,"" he said. Krenzler said early planted stands in the north-central and southwestern parts of the state are probably most vulnerable. Crops in the panhandle of Oklahoma and Texas are less developed and have some snow cover protection from the cold, he noted."
mclean's <mii> u.s. lines sets sale of assets,ship acq,"McLean Industries Inc said its two shipping subsidiaries -- UNITED States Lines Inc and United States Lines (S.A.) Inc -- have agreed in principle to dispose of substantially all their remaining operating shipping assets. The units have been operating under protection of Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since last November. McLean said U.S. Lines has a letter of intent with CSX Corp's <CSX> Sea-Land Corp subsidiary to transfer assets of its Transpacific/Hawaii/Guam Service to Sea-Land. McLean said Sea-Land has tentatively agreed to pay 125 mln dlrs for six vessels, certain port facilities, and various other equipment used in U.S. Lines' Transpacific service and theree Lancer class vessels and subsidy rights owned by the two McLean subsidiaries. As previously announced, U.S. Lines (S.A.) will transfer its South American Service to <Crowley Maritime Corp>'s American Transport Lines Inc subsidiary in return for a fixed lease payment for the four Lancer class vessels and a participation based on American Transport's South American revenues. McLean said the agreement also calls for Crowley to release U.S. Lines (S.A.) for any damages and unpaid charter hire for three vessels leased to U.S. Lines (S.A.) by Crowley which have been returned to Crowley. McLean said the minimum lease payments will be seven mln dlrs and estimated revenue participation during the first four years at about 16 mln dlrs. In addition, U.S. Lines (S.A.) subsidiaries in Brazil and Argentina will be sold to American Transport. The company said both agreements in principle have been approved by directors of the companies involved, but still need court, regulatory and lender approval. McLean said it is requesting the bankruptcy court to schedule a hearing on its motion to approve the agreements, adding that the court has granted the company's request to extend for 90 days the period for the shipping companies to file a proposed plan of reorganization. It said the planned transactions will leave McLean with no significant shipping assets except 12 New York class vessels, which are not in operation and are expected to be sold. McLean said its shipping units are returning the vessels operating in foreign commerce to United States ports to permit the planned transfer to purchasers. The company said U.S. Lines will maintain its weekly service from the U.S. West Coast to Hawaii and Guam until the vessels are transferred and the transaction is completed."
u.s. urges restraint in aegean,crude ship,"The United States said it was doing what it could to ease tension in the Aegean as Greek and Turkish warships headed for a possible clash over oil drilling rights on the sea's continental shelf. State Department spokesman Charles Redman told reporters, ""We have urged both sides to exercise restraint and avoid any actions which might exacerbate the situation."" ""In the light of the most recent developments, we are consulting with the parties and with other interested allies on means to reduce tensions,"" he added. Redman declined to elaborate on what Washington was doing, but he said an emergency meeting of NATO ambassadors in Brussels on the subject was only one path it was pursuing. He also refused to say which side was to blame for the renewed confrontation, saying Washington was still trying to ascertain all the facts, as Prime minister Andreas Papanderou said Greece was prepared to tackle any aggressor. ""The crucial point here is that these are two friends and allies. We don't want to see tension rise and we are doing what we can to see if we can help here,"" Redman said."
zimbabwe confirms hoof-and-mouth disease,livestock carcass,"Zimbabwe has confirmed an outbreak of the animal-borne hoof-and-mouth disease, which prompted Botswana on Thursday to stop imports of almost all Zimbabwean meat products. Agriculture Ministry Permanent Secretary Robbie Mupawose said it had been found at a ranch in southwestern Matabeleland province and that all measures were being taken to contain it from spreading. ""The effect of this outbreak on Zimbabwe's beef exports is being examined,"" he added in a statement. Zimbabwe exports a wide range of meat products to neighbouring states and some 8,000 tonnes of high-grade beef to the European Community annually worth about 48 mln U.S. Dlrs."
u.s. banker predicts further dollar fall this year,money-fx dlr,"A leading U.S. Banker said the dollar was likely to fall another five to 10 pct this year and an improvement in the huge American trade deficit would be only temporary at current world exchange rate levels. Kurt Viermetz, Worldwide Treasurer of <Morgan Guaranty Trust Co>, told Arab currency traders meeting here that the steady depreciation of the dollar had not gone far enough to rein in U.S. Deficits on a lasting basis. Speaking at the 14th annual congress of the Interarab Cambist Association, Viermetz said an agreement reached last month among major industrial nations to steady the dollar around current levels left many questions unanswered. ""I cannot see any chance for a real turnaround (rise) in the dollar,"" Viermetz said. ""I believe there is room for a further fall of five to 10 per cent in 1987."" The United States, West Germany, Japan, France, Great Britain and Canada -- G-6 -- agreed in Paris in late February to stabilise major currencies around current levels. The accord came after months of transatlantic argument, with Tokyo and Bonn claiming Washington's policy of talking the dollar lower had made life impossible for West German and Japanese exporters. The Paris accord also brought a pause to the continued slide of the dollar engineered by a meeting in New York in September 1985 when industrial nations agreed to depress the value of the currency to help redress global trade imbalances. But Viermetz said Morgan Guaranty's economic models showed that with no further change in exchange rates -- and continued sluggish growth in West Germany and Japan -- the U.S. Trade deficit would improve only temporarily. He said the deficit might fall to 145 billion dlrs this year from 165 billion in 1986 and further improve to 120 billion in 1988 but by 1990, it would be back around 160 billion dlrs. ""This is clearly unacceptable for the monetary authorities and politicians in Washington,"" he said. Viermetz said it was only natural that markets should attempt to test the credibility of the Paris accord, struck when the dollar was trading at about 1.83 marks and 152.50 yen. Immediately before the historic 1985 New York agreement or ""Plaza Accord,"" the dollar had been trading at 2.84 marks and 240 yen. Viermetz said he believed major nations in Paris wanted to see the dollar hold within a ""loose range"" of 1.75 to 1.90 marks and 145 to 155 yen, with any attempt to push the U.S. Currency lower being countered by central bank intervention. The dollar ended in New York yesterday at 147.15/25 yen -- its lowest level against the Japanese currency in roughly 40 years. It closed at 1.8160/70 marks. Viermetz also said he did not see the U.S. Federal funds rate falling below six pct for fear of provoking an uncontrolled fall in the dollar. But at the same time, worries about the international debt crisis would mean there was little chance of a rise above 6-3/4 pct since this would increase loan costs to the third world. The Middle East foreign exchange conference brings together more than 200 traders and bank treasury chiefs from the Arab world and Arab banks in European and U.S. Financial centres. Formal discussions, which end today, have also centred on the role of Arab banks in world financial markets, with bankers urging them to adapt to a new global trend towards securitisation of business. Hikmat Nashashibi, President of the Arab Bankers Association, said Arab banks have to shake off their old mentality of commercial banking and concentrate more on investment banking."
turkish ship in oil row heads for aegean,ship crude,"A Turkish research ship, escorted by warships and air force planes, left for the Aegean to press Ankara's case in an escalating row with Greece over oil rights, the semi-official Anatolian News Agency said. The ship set off this morning from the Dardanelles port of Canakkale with flags flying and watched by sightseers, the agency said. Prime Minister Turgut Ozal said last night the ship would not go into international waters unless Greece did the same. ""We are waiting for the first move from them,"" he told Turkish Radio in London."
"papandreou shows ""restricted optimism"" over crisis",crude ship,"Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou expressed ""restricted optimism"" about a crisis with Turkey over disputed oil rights in the Aegean Sea. Papandreou was speaking to reporters after briefing opposition political leaders on the latest developments in the row as a Turkish research ship escorted by warships and combat aircraft headed for the Aegean. He and other political leaders spoke of qualified optimism following a statement by Turkish Premier Turgut Ozal last night that the research vessel would not enter disputed waters as previously annnounced unless Greek vessels did so. The Prime Minister declined to answer reporters' questions about an announcement last night that Greece had asked the United States to suspend operations at one of the American military bases here due to the crisis. But Opposition leader Constantine Mitsotakis told reporters he thought the suspension would be temporary until the crisis is resolved. A U.S. Defence Department official in Washington said the station was still functioning. Communist Party leader Harilaos Florakis said here ""the climate is calmer today."" Greek newspapers reported that the Greek army, navy and air force had been moved to strategic Greek islands in the Aegean and to the land border with Turkey at the Evros River. But there was no official word on military movements apart from a comment by the government spokesman that the Greek navy was no longer in port. The United States, NATO and the United Nations all called on Greece and Turkey to exercise restraint. Greek U.N. Representative Mihalis Dounas said in a letter to the secretary-general that the dispute was of a legal nature and could be settled in the International Court in the Hague."
turkish-greek aegean tension abates,ship crude,"Turkey""s standoff with Greece over Aegean oil rights appeared at an end after the government said it had been assured Athens would not start prospecting in disputed waters. A Foreign Ministry statement last night hinted Turkey was claiming victory. A Greek-based international consortium, North Aegean Petroleum Co., Had given up plans to start searching for oil in international waters east of Thasos island, it said. ""In the same way it has been understood that Greece will also not undertake oil activities outside its territorial waters,"" the statement added. An Ankara Radio report monitored in London said Foreign Minister Vahit Halefolu had called on Greece to engage in dialogue over the dispute. It was impossible to resolve the dispute by crises, he was quoted as saying. ""We call on Greece to come and engage in a dialogue with us - let us find a solution as two neighbours and allies should,"" he said. The radio said Halefoglu had briefed the leaders of a number of the country""s political parties on the latest developments. Turkey sent the survey ship Sismik 1 into the Aegean yesterday, flanked by warships, to press its case but having earlier said it would go into disputed waters, declared the vessel would stay in Turkish areas. Prime Minister Turgut Ozal, in London on his way home after heart surgery in the United States, is expected to receive an ecstatic welcome from thousands of Turks when he returns today. He was in defiant mood last night, telling Turkish radio: ""We can never accept that Greece should confine us to the Anatolian continent. If there are riches under the sea, they are for mankind."" Despite the end of the crisis, Turkish officials acknowledged that the underlying dispute over delimiting the continental shelf in the Aegean remained unsolved. Turkey alleged that the consortium""s plans would have infringed the 1976 Berne agreement between the two countries, which called for a moratorium on any activities until the delimitation was agreed. Greece earlier this month declared it considers the accord inoperative."
italy relaxes restrictions on lira imports,money-fx lit,"Italy is to modify restrictions limiting the amount of lira cash that can be brought in and out of the country, the Foreign Trade Ministry said. A statement said Foreign Trade Minister Rino Formica has signed a measure lifting currency regulations that currently impose a 400,000 lire limit on the value of lira bank notes that can be brought into Italy. It did not say when the new measure would come into force. In future, there will be no limit to the amount of lira bank notes both residents and non-residents can bring into Italy. The statement said the 400,000 lire limit would remain for Italian residents wishing to take cash out of the country, but non-residents could re-export lira cash if they made appropriate declarations at customs points. It said the lifting of the restrictions ""reinforces the international status of the lira and meets the requirements expressed several times by foreign exchange dealers."""
turkey lifts survey ship escort as tension abates,ship crude,"Turkey pulled warships back from close escort of its Sismik 1 survey ship as the threat of conflict with Greece over oil rights in the Aegean Sea abated. The semi-official Anatolian Agency said naval vessels ended their close protection of the ship as it continued work in Turkish waters but were following it at a distance. Popular newspapers headlined what they saw as Turkish resolve and international pressure forcing Greece to pull back from planned exploration in disputed international waters. ""Intense United States and NATO efforts bore fruit: Greece will stay in its national waters,"" said the daily Gunes. The top-selling Hurriyet topped its front page with: ""Our resolute stand made Greece see reason."" But two newspapers, Cumhuriyet and Milliyet, noted in identical headlines -- ""Crisis Frozen"" -- that the basic disagreement over exploration rights remained unsolved. The confrontation eased after the Turkish government said it had been assured Athens would not begin prospecting in disputed waters."
u.s. sees more harmony in talks with france,trade grain,"The U.S. Expects more harmonious talks than usual during French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac's first official visit this week as frequently rancorous disputes between the two countries begin to fade. ""The Libyan bombing is a thing of the past, the trade war didn't happen and we have reached reasonably good cooperation on terrorism,"" one U.S. Official told Reuters. ""It looks like a reasonably harmonious visit in prospect, more harmonious than usual."" Since taking office a year ago, Chirac has been obliged to deal with a series of potentially serious disputes with the United States. During the U.S. Bombing of alleged terrorist targets in Libya last April, France refused to allow British-based U.S. Planes to overfly its territory, forcing them to take a circuitous route. That angered Washington. The U.S. Officials, who asked not to be identified, said a year ago Washington felt the French were not taking strong enough action against terrorism. ""Now they are. We're pleased and they are pleased that we are pleased,"" one said. More recently, a dispute over U.S. Access to the grain markets of Spain and Portugal after they joined the European Community threatened to become a trade war. In retaliation for what Washington saw as deliberate Community moves to exclude U.S. Grain, the United States was poised to impose swingeing tariffs on European Community food imports and a major trade war was averted at the last minute. Last week, the forces of President Hissene Habre of Chad, supported, trained and armed by Paris and Washington, scored a major success by pushing Libyan troops out of their last bases in northern Chad. A French official added: ""There is also a common interest in getting Japan to cut its trade surplus with the rest of the world by opening up its markets."" Although relations have improved markedly between the two countries, many irritants remain. At the top of the list is the Community's common agricultural policy (CAP). To Washington, as one official put it, ""CAP is the root of all evil"" in international food trade because it subsidises farmers and sells vast amounts of excess produce at below world prices, thereby eating into U.S. Markets."
japan central bank buys one billion dlrs in tokyo,money-fx dlr,"The Bank of Japan has already purchased more than one billion dlrs in intervention since the opening and continues to buy the U.S. Currency, dealers said. The central bank was supporting the dollar against the yen amid heavy selling pressure from investment trusts and securities houses which had pushed the dollar as low as 144.75 yen earlier this morning, they said. The dollar recovered slightly from the intervention and was trading around 145.00, they added. It had opened in Tokyo at 145.80 yen."
sumita says he does not expect further dollar fall,money-fx dlr,"Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said he does not expect the dollar to remain unstable and fall further. He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that the Bank of Japan would continue to cooperate closely with other major nations to stabilize exchange rates. The central bank has been keeping extremely careful watch on exchange rate movements since last week, he said. He said the dollar would not continue to fall because of underlying market concern about the rapid rise of the yen. Sumita said the currency market has been reacting to overseas statements and to trade tension between Japan and the U.S. Over semiconductors. The yen's tendency to rise will prevent Japan from expanding domestic demand and undertaking necessary economic restructuring, he said."
dlr falls on fear tokyo won't hike demand-miyazawa,money-fx dlr,Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said that the dollar's drop today to 145 yen is partly attributable to the perception inside and outside Japan that the country has failed to fulfill its promise to expand domestic demand. He told a Lower House budget committee in Parliament that it was natural for other nations to think that Japan is not doing enough because of the delay in the passage of the 1987/88 budget. The budget has been delayed by opposition boycotts of Parliament to protest government plans for a new sales tax.
g-6 wants to hold dlr above 150 yen - nakasone,money-fx dlr yen,"Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said that Japan and other industrialized nations committed themselves in Paris last month to stabilize the dollar above 150 yen. He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that the six nations have taken measures, including market intervention, to support the dollar above that level. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told the same committee that the six - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - had intervened aggressively since the dollar fell below 150 yen. Miyazawa said major nations are trying hard to stabilize exchange rates. Asked if there had been any change in the fundamentals of each nation since the February 22 Paris accord, he said he did not think the fundamentals themselves had changed substantially. But he said the market is sensitively looking at what is happening in major nations. He did not elaborate. Miyazawa added that it was difficult to say why there has been such speculative dollar selling in the market."
"japan isolated, yen rises, world feels cheated",money-fx yen dlr,"Japan is becoming dangerously isolated again as the U.S. And Europe feel they have been cheated by Japanese promises to switch from export to domestic-led growth, officials and businessmen from around the world said. As the dollar today slipped to a record low below 145 yen, making Japanese exporters and holders of dollar investments grit their teeth harder, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said there was a perception Japan had reneged on its promise. The problem goes deep and centres on misunderstandings by both sides over the key Maekawa report of April, last year. The document was prepared by a private committee formed by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and led by former Bank of Japan head Haruo Maekawa. It recommended that to stop friction due to its large trade surpluses, Japan must ""make a historical transformation in its traditional policies on economic management and the nation's lifestyle. There can be no further development for Japan without this transformation."" Americans and Europeans took the report to heart and have looked in vain for clear signs of this historic change. But the Japanese remain doubtful about the short, or even medium term prospects of totally transforming their economic habits. The bubble of frustration against what appears as Japanese prevarication burst last week. The U.S. Said it intended to raise tariffs of as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese exports to the U.S. On the grounds Japan had abrogated a bilateral semiconductor pact. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher threatened to block Japanese financial firms from London after the Japanese placed what the British say are restrictive conditions on a bid by British firm Cable and Wireless to join a domestic telecommunications joint venture. On Friday, European currency dealers said European central banks, annoyed at restrictive Japanese trade practises, might leave Japan alone to intervene to staunch the rise of the yen. Eishiro Saito, head of top Japanese business group Keidanren, spotted the dangers inherent in such contradictory views last November when he visited the European Community. ""Related to this matter of (trade) imbalance, the point that I found to be of great cause for alarm during this trip to Europe was the excessive degree of hope placed by the Europeans in the results of the Maekawa report,"" he said. ""We explained that the process of restructuring the economy away from its dependence on exports toward a balance between domestic and external demand...Would take time,"" Saito said. Saito's words were ignored. In February, EC Industrial Policy Director Heinrich von Moltke came to Japan and said ""I only know that your government, under the leadership of Maekawa, points to restructuring your economy into a less outward looking, more inward looking one. It is the Maekawa report which has attracted the most attention in Europe."" And Europeans and Americans want quick action. ""A far better answer than protectionism would be structural change within the Japanese economy, the kind suggested by the Maekawa report. And we hope to see changes occur in the near future,"" visiting Chairman of General Motors Roger Smith said in March. Such expectations are now ingrained, which was partly the fault of Nakasone, who heralded Maekawa's report as a sea of change in Japanese affairs, said U.S. Officials. Months before the report was issued, U.S. And EC business leaders met their Japanese colleagues to discuss the trade problem. ""We are more anxious than ever that the new approach of the Maekawa committee does lead to speedy and effective action,"" said EC Industrial Union leader Lord Ray Pennock. ""The important implication of the Maekawa report is that it is finally looking to let Japanese enjoy the fruits of their labour,"" said Philip Caldwell, Senior Managing Director of Shearson Lehman Brothers. Contents of the report were leaded well ahead of issuance. Japanese officials say they are implementing the report as fast as they can, said a European ambassador who has travelled the country asking about this issue. He said People mentioned many things in line with the spirit of the report, including restructuring of the coal and steel industries. A major misunderstanding is that the private report was government policy. Europeans are confused about this, underlined by von Moltke's reference to the ""leadership"" of the Maekawa report. Even so, Japanese officials point to last September's government programme of new economic measures. ""Without endorsing the report as policy, officials point out that the government has put its signature to a programme designed to implement the report,"" the ambassador said."
h.k. dealers say nakasone g-6 comment too late,money-fx dlr yen,"Remarks by Japan's Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone that last month's G-6 meeting agreed to stabilize the dollar above 150 yen have come too late to influence currency trading, dealers said. After Nakasone's statement the dollar rose to 146.40/50 yen from an initial low of 144.20/40 and New York's Friday finish of 147.15/25. But the rebound was largely on short-covering, they said. ""I think (Nakasone's) desperate,"" said a U.S. Bank foreign exchange manager. Nakasone told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that Japan and other industrialized nations committed themselves in Paris last month to stabilize the dollar above 150 yen. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told the same committee that the six - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - had intervened aggressively since the dollar fell below 150 yen. ""His (Nakasone) remarks should have been made and should have had a bigger influence when the dollar was still above 150 yen,"" said P.S. Tam of Morgan Guaranty Trust. Tam said the dollar has hit short-term chart targets and is likely to rebound. But he warned of another dip to below 145 yen. Dealers said the worsening trade relations between the U.S. And Japan will continue to depress the dollar. The trade issue has now become a political issue since the Reagan Administration is facing uproar in Congress over th3pYgks in cutting the country's 169.8 billion dlr trade deficit, they said."
japan actively bought u.s. corn last week - trade,grain corn,"Japanese feed and starch makers actively bought U.S. Corn last week, C and F basis, for July/September shipment in view of bullish freight rates following active inquiries by the Soviet Union, trade sources said. Some said the makers were seen buying some 30 pct of their requirements, estimated at about three mln tonnes for the three-month shipment period. ""Belief is growing that freight rates will not decline sharply from current high levels even in the usually sluggish summer season because the Soviet Union's chartering is seen continuing five to seven months from April,"" one source said. The sources said Japanese trading houses were seen covering a total of 500,000 tonnes of Chinese corn for shipment in May to October. But they are believed to have not yet sold most of the corn to end-users in anticipation of further corn price rises in the world market. Supply from Argentina and South Africa for July/September is still uncertain. But the sources forecast supplies from Argentina may fall to 400,000 to 500,000 tonnes from an anticipated 800,000 in calendar 1987 and from South Africa to 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes from an estimated one mln in light of tighter export availability."
japan buys large amount of brazilian soybeans,oilseed soybean,"Japanese crushers have bought some 214,000 tonnes of Brazilian soybeans for late April/early July shipment and may buy up to 140,000 to 190,000 tonnes more for June to August shipment, trade sources said. Japan imported 128,089 tonnes of Brazilian beans in calendar 1986, Finance Ministry customs-cleared statistics show. The sources said Brazilian beans were cheaper than U.S. Origin which may account for the heavy purchases, but added there were concerns about deliveries from Brazil in the near term due to labour problems there. The Japanese purchases comprise 30,000 tonnes for April 20/May 10 shipment, 102,000 for May, 15,000 for late May/early June, 36,000 for June, and 31,000 for late June/early July shipment, the sources said. As a result of the large volumes of Brazilian beans purchased, Japanese crushers will buy a total of only 150,000 tonnes of U.S. Beans for May shipment. Some 100,000 of this shipment has already been purchased, the sources added. They said crushers bought some 270,000 to 280,000 tonnes of U.S. Beans for April shipment."

indonesian rupiah slips against mark and yen,money-fx rupiah dmk yen,"The Indonesian rupiah has held steady since its 31 pct devaluation against the dollar six months ago, but has slipped against the mark and to a lesser extent against the yen, according to central bank figures. In the past month, the rupiah has fallen five pct against the yen. Today's middle rate per 100 yen was 1,129.78 against 1,075.20 at end-February and 1,058.6 at devaluation in September. Bank Indonesia's quoted rate for the dollar, the main currency for Indonesia's oil and gas exports, was 1,644.0 today, the same rate fixed at the time of devaluation. The rate for the West German mark was 913.28 today, a sharp drop from September when it was 786.06. The British pound has risen to 2,657.93 against 2,429.83. The value of the rupiah is set daily against a basket of currencies by the central bank. The rise in the value of the mark and the yen has hit Indonesia by increasing its debt servicing levels. Its total disbursed foreign debt is estimated by the World Bank at 37 billion dlrs. Japan is one of Indonesia's key trading partners, taking half its oil exports."
philippine coconut industry worried by ec tax,oilseed coconut,"Philippine coconut oil exports to Europe would be virtually wiped out if the European Community (EC) implements a new tax on vegetable oils, Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) chairman Jose Romero said. But he told reporters he did not think the EC would impose the tax because of objections from the U.S. ""There's just so much flak coming from many countries, spearheaded by the United States, whose soybean exports would be adversely affected. This would spark a trade war,"" he said. The tax, to be imposed from July, would add about 375 dlrs a tonne to vegetable oils entering the EC. The Philippines exported 43,540 tonnes of coconut oil worth 11.7 mln dlrs to Europe in January, against total exports of 86,959 tonnes worth 23.8 mln. It also exports copra and copra meal. Agriculture Secretary Carlos Dominguez has also raised objections to the proposed EC tax. He said it could cause the collapse of world demand and prices and destroy the domestic industry."

The minister believes that market forces will push the dollar back up from its record low of 144.70 yen today, according to the spokesman.

Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told the same committee that the six - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - had intervened aggressively since the dollar fell below 150 yen. Miyazawa said major nations are trying hard to stabilize exchange rates. Asked if there had been any change in the fundamentals of each nation since the February 22 Paris accord, he said he did not think the fundamentals themselves had changed substantially. But he said the market is sensitively looking at what is happening in major nations. He did not elaborate.

He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that the Bank of Japan would continue to cooperate closely with other major nations to stabilize exchange rates. The central bank has been keeping extremely careful watch on exchange rate movements since last week, he said. He said the dollar would not continue to fall because of underlying market concern about the rapid rise of the yen. Sumita said the currency market has been reacting to overseas statements and to trade tension between Japan and the U.S. over semiconductors. The yen's tendency to rise will prevent Japan from expanding domestic demand and undertaking necessary economic restructuring, he said."
"dlr falls on fears, miyazawa says",money-fx dlr yen,Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said that the dollar's drop today to 145 yen is partly attributable to the perception inside and outside Japan that the country has failed to fulfill its promise to expand domestic demand. He told a Lower House budget committee in Parliament that it was natural for other nations to think that Japan is not doing enough because of the delay in the passage of the 1987/88 budget. The budget has been delayed by opposition boycotts of Parliament to protest government plans for a new sales tax.
"japan isolated, yen rises, world feels cheated",trade money-fx,"Japan is becoming dangerously isolated again as the U.S. And Europe feel they have been cheated by Japanese promises to switch from export to domestic-led growth, officials and businessmen from around the world said. As the dollar today slipped to a record low below 145 yen, making Japanese exporters and holders of dollar investments grit their teeth harder, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said there was a perception Japan had reneged on its promise. The problem goes deep and centres on misunderstandings by both sides over the key Maekawa report of April, last year. The document was prepared by a private committee formed by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and led by former Bank of Japan head Haruo Maekawa. It recommended that to stop friction due to its large trade surpluses, Japan must ""make a historical transformation in its traditional policies on economic management and the nation's lifestyle. There can be no further development for Japan without this transformation."" Americans and Europeans took the report to heart and have looked in vain for clear signs of this historic change. But the Japanese remain doubtful about the short, or even medium term prospects of totally transforming their economic habits. The bubble of frustration against what appears as Japanese prevarication burst last week. The U.S. Said it intended to raise tariffs of as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese exports to the U.S. On the grounds Japan had abrogated a bilateral semiconductor pact. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher threatened to block Japanese financial firms from London after the Japanese placed what the British say are restrictive conditions on a bid by British firm Cable and Wireless to join a domestic telecommunications joint venture. On Friday, European currency dealers said European central banks, annoyed at restrictive Japanese trade practises, might leave Japan alone to intervene to staunch the rise of the yen. Eishiro Saito, head of top Japanese business group Keidanren, spotted the dangers inherent in such contradictory views last November when he visited the European Community. ""Related to this matter of (trade) imbalance, the point that I found to be of great cause for alarm during this trip to Europe was the excessive degree of hope placed by the Europeans in the results of the Maekawa report,"" he said. ""We explained that the process of restructuring the economy away from its dependence on exports toward a balance between domestic and external demand...Would take time,"" Saito said. Saito's words were ignored. In February, EC Industrial Policy Director Heinrich von Moltke came to Japan and said ""I only know that your government, under the leadership of Maekawa, points to restructuring your economy into a less outward looking, more inward looking one. It is the Maekawa report which has attracted the most attention in Europe."" And Europeans and Americans want quick action. ""A far better answer than protectionism would be structural change within the Japanese economy, the kind suggested by the Maekawa report. And we hope to see changes occur in the near future,"" visiting Chairman of General Motors Roger Smith said in March. Such expectations are now ingrained, which was partly the fault of Nakasone, who heralded Maekawa's report as a sea of change in Japanese affairs, said U.S. Officials. Months before the report was issued, U.S. And EC business leaders met their Japanese colleagues to discuss the trade problem. ""We are more anxious than ever that the new approach of the Maekawa committee does lead to speedy and effective action,"" said EC Industrial Union leader Lord Ray Pennock. ""The important implication of the Maekawa report is that it is finally looking to let Japanese enjoy the fruits of their labour,"" said Philip Caldwell, Senior Managing Director of Shearson Lehman Brothers. Contents of the report were leaded well ahead of issuance. Japanese officials say they are implementing the report as fast as they can, said a European ambassador who has travelled the country asking about this issue. He said People mentioned many things in line with the spirit of the report, including restructuring of the coal and steel industries. A major misunderstanding is that the private report was government policy. Europeans are confused about this, underlined by von Moltke's reference to the ""leadership"" of the Maekawa report. Even so, Japanese officials point to last September's government programme of new economic measures. ""Without endorsing the report as policy, officials point out that the government has put its signature to a programme designed to implement the report,"" the ambassador said."
u.s. appears to tolerate further dlr decline,money-fx trade,"In a bid to hasten Japan's promise to speed up its economic growth and open markets to foreign trade, top U.S. officials appear once again to have signaled their tolerance of a lower dollar. Treasury Secretary James Baker and one of his top aides, Assistant Secretary David Mulford, said last week there was no target for the dollar, a statement that sent the yen soaring against the dollar, despite massive central bank intervention. ""That was no slip of the tongue,"" said one western monetary official, who asked not to be identified. For now, the strategy appears to be working. Japanese officials said late last week a package to bolster domestic demand will be ready in early April. Until last week, there were few indications the package would be ready anytime soon. The Reagan administration, facing an uproar in Congress over the apparent lack of progress in cutting the 169.8 billion dlr trade deficit, is learning now that to extract results from Japan, dramatic action is required. Last week the White House imposed unprecedented tariffs on certain Japanese electronic goods after Tokyo failed to adhere to a semi-conductor pricing accord between the two countries. The shift in U.S. strategy, in part designed to appease mounting Congressional anger over Japanese policies, comes just two weeks before industrial nations reconvene here to review the Paris agreement to stabilize currencies. And news that Japan earned a record 18 billion dlr trade surplus in the first two months this year just underscored the need for urgent action, in the view of U.S. officials. Nonetheless, U.S. officials see signs of improvement in the deficit. ""I'd be stunned if we were not going to derive some benefits (from the lower dollar) soon,"" said one. In Paris, leading industrial nations agreed to cooperate closely to foster currency stability within ranges reflecting ""underlying economic fundamentals"" or economic reality. The agreement envisages those fundamentals to include Japan and West Germany stimulating their economies and the United States cutting its budget deficit. The three nations, joined by France, Britain and Canada, agree these policies are essential to redress huge global trade imbalances. But analysts say markets have signalled the underlying fundamentals imply a lower dollar, rather than a stable one. Markets, in effect, are less confident than governments that these measures -- including U.S. budget deficit cuts agreed by Congress and the White House --will be carried out. Nonetheless, the dollar's sharp fall has not undermined cooperation. A U.S. economic policymaker said the accord was on track and Tokyo and Bonn seem ""to want more stimulative measures which is what the Paris accord calls for."" International monetary sources said exchange market developments generally have not unsettled policymakers, although Japan is an obvious exception. ""Everybody feels it can still be managed,"" one source said of market developments. But last week, the Bank of Japan spent an estimated five billion dlrs intervening to halt the rise in the yen, and other central banks about one billion dlrs. Another monetary source said Japan was upset with America's half-hearted attempt to halt the falling dollar, flouting the Paris accord outright. The source, close to the top levels of Japanese economic policymaking, said Japan's understanding of the accord was that the yen would be kept at around 154 to the dollar, the level it stood at when the accord was struck. The source said Tokyo was extremely worried by Washington's use of the exchange rate to change Japanese policies. It was a ""pointed reminder"" to Japan to do something about the trade issues, the source said of the dollar's fall against the yen. By departing last Sunday from the language of the Paris accord -- that nations agreed to foster currency stability around current levels -- Baker triggered a run on the dollar. Later in the week, Mulford too said there was no target for the dollar and called on Japan and West Germany to live up to their international responsibilities and stimulate growth. But U.S. officials said recent market developments will not unravel the spirit of the Paris agreement. ""There's a realisation now that you cannot leave things alone, everyone agrees that the external (trade) imbalances ought to be adjusted,"" one official said. ""While no-one is going to cede national sovereignty, we certainly seem to be moving towards much closer co-operation,"" another U.S. official said. The officials said the meeting here, where the six will be joined by Italy, will be a status report. ""Japan will have to explain what the state of their program is and Germany will report on its plans. Maybe there's a need to move faster,"" one source said. Mulford told Congress last week the Paris accord called, in effect, for currency stability for several months. This would buy time for Japan and West Germany to speed up their economic growth and help bring down the U.S. trade deficit. His comments appeared to serve notice on other major nations that Washington cannot wait too long for action to reduce the gap between the Japanese and German trade surpluses and the U.S. trade deficit."

greece scraps u.s. base closure request,crude ship,"Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou has withdrawn a request to Washington to suspend operations at an American army base near Athens as a Greek-Turkish row over oil rights in the Aegean eased. A Turkish research ship which Greece had threatened to tackle if it sailed into disputed waters in the Aegean Sea kept to Turkish territorial waters yesterday, avoiding a potential clash. Papandreou expressed qualified optimism after briefing opposition leaders on Aegean developments early yesterday. The Greek government later withdrew Friday's request to Washington to close down its telecommunications base at Nea Makri, north of Athens, saying that the reasons which had prompted it to make the request were no longer valid. Under the terms of the U.S.-Greek bases accord, Greece has the right to ask for suspension of operations at times when its national interests are threatened. The row in the Aegean erupted after Turkey said it would search for oil round three Greek islands off its coast following an announcement from Greece that it planned to drill east of Thassos island after taking control of a Canadian-led oil consortium operating in the northern Aegean. Turkey accused Greece of breaching the 1976 Berne Agreement under which both sides agreed to preserve the status quo in the Aegean until their continental shelf dispute was settled. Athens says it considers the accord inactive. The Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement it had received an assurance from Greece that it would not carry out oil activities outside its territorial waters. Greece declined comment on the statement. Papandreou repeated an invitation to Turkey to take the long-standing continental shelf dispute to the International Court of Justice at The Hague. Conservative opposition leader Constantine Mitsotakis said he had urged Papandreou to accept an offer from NATO General Secretary Lord Carrington to help resolve the row."

"japan set to ride out yen rise, officials say",money-fx yen,"The government is determined to ride out the latest sharp rise of the yen without taking panic measures because it expects the currency's appreciation to prove temporary, senior officials said. ""The market has already located a ceiling (for the yen) and market forces are pushing the dollar back up a bit,"" one senior Finance Ministry official said. He attributed the dollar's fall in recent days to special factors, in particular, selling by Japanese investors ahead of the March 31 end to their fiscal year. That selling largely came to an end this morning after about one hour of trading here, the senior official said. ""They (the investors) became more or less quiet after 10 o'clock (0100 GMT),"" he said. After falling to a record low of 144.70 yen this morning, the dollar edged back up in late trading to end at 146.20. Dealers attributed the late rise to remarks by Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone that major nations had agreed to stabilise the dollar above 150 yen. Several officials said they did not see any fundamental reason for the dollar's recent sharp fall. One official even called the market's recent actions irrational. If anything, the U.S. Decision to slap tariffs on Japanese electronics goods should support the dollar against the yen because it will cut Japanese exports to the U.S., He said. As a result, several officials said they saw no reason to alter the broad thrust of government policy agreed to at last month's meeting of major nations in Paris. ""We don't see any substantial reason to change our policy stance,"" one senior officia"
h.k. dealers say nakasone g-6 comment too late,money-fx trade,"Remarks by Japan's Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone that last month's G-6 meeting agreed to stabilize the dollar above 150 yen have come too late to influence currency trading, dealers said. After Nakasone's statement the dollar rose to 146.40/50 yen from an initial low of 144.20/40 and New York's Friday finish of 147.15/25. But the rebound was largely on short-covering, they said. ""I think (Nakasone's) desperate,"" said a U.S. Bank foreign exchange manager. Nakasone told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that Japan and other industrialized nations committed themselves in Paris last month to stabilize the dollar above 150 yen. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told the same committee that the six - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - had intervened aggressively since the dollar fell below 150 yen. ""His (Nakasone) remarks should have been made and should have had a bigger influence when the dollar was still above 150 yen,"" said P.S. Tam of Morgan Guaranty Trust. Tam said the dollar has hit short-term chart targets and is likely to rebound. But he warned of another dip to below 145 yen. Dealers said the worsening trade relations between the U.S. And Japan will continue to depress the dollar. The trade issue has now become a political issue since the Reagan Administration is facing uproar in Congress over th3pYgks in cutting the country's 169.8 billion dlr trade deficit, they said."
sri lanka appeals for drought relief aid,grain wheat rice,"Sri Lanka has appealed to 24 countries for emergency aid to help 2.4 mln villagers affected by the country's worst drought in 36 years, government officials said. Embassies received letters over the weekend outlining aid needed for a sixth of Sri Lanka's population in 13 districts. The letter said the government had to step in ""to avert serious economic hardship"" and because the Social Services Ministry had already used up its entire 1987 budget provision of 23 mln rupees by distributing help to the worst hit areas. The letter said 548.76 mln rupees were needed for a six month period, at least until the May-September (Yala) rice crop was harvested. Over 25,000 tonnes of wheat, rice, flour and other cereals were required, it said, along with supplies of sugar, lentils, dried or canned fish and milk. In some of the most seriously affected districts, the Maha (October 1986-April 1987) crop had been ""almost completely devastated,"" the letter said. Maha paddy output was now estimated at 70 mln bushels, 20 mln less than originally expected. There were two scenarios for the Yala crop, with a high forecast of around 40 mln bushels conditional on adequate rainfall within the next three to four weeks. ""Should the present drought continue, however, production is estimated at around 20 mln bushels,"" the letter added. Total estimated paddy output for 1987 would be between 90 and 110 mln bushels, or 1.35 to 1.65 mln tonnes of rice. Last year's output was 124 mln bushels, down from 127 mln in 1985. The letter said villagers in most seriously affected districts had been deprived of any means of subsistence because subsidiary crops had also failed. It said the government's current budget did not permit it to provide sustained and adequate relief to those affected. ""Revenue has been adversely affected by depressed commodity prices and slowing of the economy. Defence commitments continue to exert pressure on the expenditure side."" The 548.76 mln cash would cover payments of 150 rupees per month for each family, as well as handling, transport and distribution of emergency food. But such an outlay of funds by the government would not be possible without seriously impairing development projects, or ""greatly fuelling inflation"" in the economy, the letter said. The letter said the Food Department would be able to release wheat and rice from the buffer stock to meet the immediate cereal requirements ""provided such stocks are replaced subsequently."" The Meteorological Department said the country was experiencing its worst drought since 1951 and the four-month dry spell prevailing in most of the areas would only break when the monsoon rains fell in late May. The letter said some areas had been experiencing the drought since August, and in the rice growing district of Kurunegala there had been no effective rainfall since June 1986."

u.s. corporate finance - new zealand dlr frns,nzdlr austdlr,"Floating-rate notes denominated in a foreign currency, a relatively new wrinkle on Wall Street, will probably be issued infrequently because the so-called ""window of opportunity"" opens and closes quickly, traders say. ""In just two days we had as many issues. As a result, the market became glutted,"" said one trader. He said the window depends more on supply than on foreign exchange or interest rate risk, at least for the moment. ""Obviously, currency risk is important. But there is a limited number of investors right now for the paper,"" he said. On Thursday, Bear, Stearns and Co sole-managed a 100 mln New Zealand dlr offering of three-year floating-rate notes issued by Ford Motor Credit Co, a unit of Ford Motor Co <F>. The initial rate for the notes will be set on April 15, and quarterly after that, at 200 basis points below the 90-day New Zealand bank bill rate. They are non-callable for life. This followed by a week another Bear Stearns-led offering of the same amount of New Zealand dollar notes for Dow Chemical Co <DOW>. The initial rate was also to be initially set on April 15, and quarterly after that, at 340 basis points below the same 90-day New Zealand rate. Because the Dow Chemical notes carried an interest rate floor of 17 pct, the issue saw strong investor demand, underwriters said. But the Ford Credit notes and Friday's offering of 130 mln New Zealand dlrs of floating-rate notes due 1990 issued by General Electric Co's <GE> General Electric Credit Corp via Prudential-Bache Securities Inc, did not have such a floor. ""Obviously, the two firms did not want to issue floaters and face the risk of New Zealand rates falling sharply,"" an underwriter away from the syndicates said. He and others noted that the New Zealand 90-day rate was 27 pct late last week. An underwriter familiar with the Dow Chemical deal pointed out that because of the interest rate and currency swaps Dow did, the issuer felt comfortable setting a rate floor. Domestic offerings of foreign currency denominated date first surfaced in Fall 1985. By using currency and rate swaps, companies can sell debt that pays a high interest rate in a foreign currency like Australian or New Zealand dollars. But the issuers actually realize savings on borrowing costs. ""I would say that every company which issued foreign currency debt saved some basis points when compared to same-maturity plain vanilla U.S. issues,"" an analyst said. Investors, mainly institutions, were attracted to the early issues because of the high interest rates. They were willing to absorb foreign currency risk until mid-1986, when sharp slides posted by the Australian and New Zealand dollars brought such issuance to a quick halt. It was not until late last year, after the currencies stabilized, that companies again started issuing debt denominated in Australian and New Zealand dollars. But many investors have still shied away from the debt, remembering the mid-1986 downturn of the Australian and New Zealand dollars, analysts noted. To attract some of those investors back to the fold, underwriters like Bear Stearns decided to structure the foreign currency issues as floating rate debt, sources said. This occurred against a backdrop of uncertainty over the course of U.S. interest rates for the intermediate term, and predictions by a number of economists that Treasury yields would rise in the second half of the year, the sources noted. A Bear Stearns officer said more than half of the Ford Credit notes were sold by late Friday afternoon, the second day of offering. ""That is quicker than some recent fixed-rate New Zealand dollar note issues,"" he said. However, underwriters away from the Bear Stearns syndicate said the issue may have sold even faster if Prudential-Bache did not offer the General Electric Credit notes on Friday. They pointed out that the Ford notes were rated A-1 by Moody's Investors and AA-minus by Standard and Poor's, while the General Electric notes, which had the same interest rate terms and were also non-callable to maturity, carried top-flight AAA ratings by both agencies. ""We have sold 20 to 25 pct of the GE notes. For first-day sales on a Friday afternoon, I'm happy with the results,"" an officer on Prudential-Bache's syndicate desk said. Investors pay the U.S. dollar equivalent of the foreign currency-denominated notes, underwriters said. Investment bankers said the next floating-rate issue of New Zealand or Australian dollar-denominated debt is probably a few weeks away. ""I would like to underwrite a deal a day. But with the Dow, Ford and GE offerings, the marketplace has had enough for the time being,"" the Prudential-Bache officer admitted. Meanwhile, IDD Information Services said the 30-day corporate visible supply fell to 3.29 billion dlrs last week from 3.98 billion dlrs in the previous week."

paris meet agreed not to publish bands - lawson,money-fx stg,"U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the meeting of six major industrial nations in Paris last month agreed not to publish any bands in connection with their pact to stabilise currencies. Questioned by a parliamentary select committee about why the participating countries had not announced any bands, Lawson replied, ""we all agreed it would be much more sensible not to."" When asked whether that meant an informal joint currency float with set ranges was arranged in Paris, Lawson said ""I do not want to reveal the precise nature of the agreement, so as not to make it easy for"" speculation against the accord. Lawson said the Paris accord presumed that individual countries would take corrective action if their currency began reacting significantly to domestic macroeconomic factors. But if such movements were due to extraneous factors, Lawson said the other pact countries would come to its aid through concerted intervention on the foreign exchanges. ""It is clear that both Germany and Japan are having difficulty adjusting to their very large exchange rate appreciations and making their economies more domestically oriented, just as it is taking time for the United States to make its own economy more export oriented,"" Lawson said. In his oral evidence to Parliament's Select Treasury Committee, Lawson repeated that he was happy with the pound's current level, adding that ""It is an objective ... To try to keep it around that level."" He said the perception of sterling on foreign exchanges had changed since the steep drop in oil prices, largely because the pound had weathered that period so successfully. ""There has been a reassessment of sterling's fundamentals,"" Lawson said. He disagreed with what he termed ""the grossly exaggerated claim"" that real U.K. Interest rates were much higher than those of other major industrialsed countries. Using as a reference the key three-month sterling interbank rate as quoted in London, Lawson said Britain now had a real interest rate level of 5.75 pct - the same as Japan did and only a 0.75 percentaage point above the Group of Five average. Lawson confirmed that ""over the medium and longer term, the government's objective is zero inflation."" He said the government's intention of its PSBR constant at 1.0 pct of GDP ""is the modern equivalent of the balanced budget doctrine."" He added that ""to allow the debt/GDP ratio to remain constant on anything other than zero inflation basis is simply a recipe for accelerating inflation."""
usda to update winter wheat acreage tomorrow,grain wheat,"The U.S. Agriculture Department said it will update its estimate of winter wheat seeded acreage in the prospective planting report, scheduled for release at 1500 est (2100 gmt) tomorrow, March 31.

fed's policy ease may end with 2nd qtr rate cut,interest gnp,"The Federal Reserve's move to easier monetary policy, begun with four quick half-point discount rate cuts in 1986, will likely end with a final rate drop in the second quarter, analysts said. A poll of 10 economists shows most expect interest rates to edge lower, with the Fed likely to drop its basic lending rate from 5-1/2 pct late next quarter to help the economy. ""The Fed is not likely to ease policy much further without a full-blown recession,"" said Raymond Stone, chief financial economist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. Stone said economic data available by late June may be just weak enough to prompt one more discount rate cut. But he said it may only be a quarter-point drop instead of the usual half point, to avoid hurting the dollar further. All of the economists agreed that the Federal Open Market Committee tomorrow will leave Fed policy unchanged. The average forecast of those surveyed projects roughly quarter-point drops by the end of June in both the Treasury bond yield, to 7-1/2 pct, and the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another, to 5-7/8 pct. Most expect the prime lending rate at major banks to remain at 7-1/2 pct. Other broad predictions of the survey, relating mainly to the April-June quarter, follow: - The dollar is likely to decline five to 10 pct further against other major currencies because of a large U.S. budget deficit and a wide, but narrowing, trade gap. Contacted after the dollar's steep drop in the last two business days, the economists reaffirmed this view but stressed the risk is that the dollar will fall more, rather than less, than they expect. - Oil prices in the second quarter are likely to continue trading roughly between 16 and 19 dlrs a barrel and could well test the lower end of that range. - Stocks will continue to outperform bonds next quarter and probably for all of 1987. Stocks should gain on strong foreign demand and a modest second-half economic rise. The outlook for bonds also is less favorable later in the year since both inflation and interest rates may be edging up. - Inflation as measured by the GNP implicit price deflator will rise to around 3.3 pct this year from 2.7 pct in 1986. The sharp fall in the dollar to date will add to inflation, as will a mild economic pickup in the second half of this year. - U.S. real gross national product, which grew at a two pct annual rate in the 1986 second half, should expand at respective rates of about 2.3 pct and 2.5 pct in the 1987 first and second halves. First-quarter growth is put at a 2.4 pct annual rate, slowing to 2.1 pct next quarter. Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International sees both the strongest economy and the highest interest rates among those surveyed. He expects real GNP, which grew at a 1.1 pct rate in fourth-quarter 1986, to expand at a 3.3 pct rate this quarter and 3.5 pct next quarter. ""The economy will bounce back more strongly than many expect,"" Brusca said. He said an involuntary buildup in inventories, largely in autos, will add to first-quarter economic growth, with consumer spending helping later. ""We're running out of special factors to keep the economy afloat,"" said Philip Braverman of Irving Securities Corp. His interest rate and economic forecasts were among the lowest. Braverman said tax law changes and inventory accumulation helped lift fourth and first quarter GNP growth, respectively. He expects 2.5 pct first quarter growth but said that second quarter growth could be zero or negative. Braverman said economic activity next quarter will suffer from a paring of inventories, lower capital investment, slow government spending and less construction. Only a marginally narrower trade deficit will add to growth. He sees a 7.10 pct end-of-June yield on Treasury bonds, with Federal funds and prime rates at 5.50 and seven pct, respectively. Nikko's Brusca projects rates of 8.25 pct for bonds, 6.15 pct for funds and 7.75 pct for the prime rate. Two of the 10 economists revised rate forecasts up mildly after the dollar's fall to 40-year lows versus the yen in past days and news of pending U.S. trade sanctions against Japan. David Resler of Nomura Securities Co International Inc raised his end-June bond yield forecast to 7.50 pct from 7.20 pct and a Fed funds rate estimate to six pct from 5.80 pct. Raul Nicho, president of Money Market Services Inc, lifted his forecast of bond and Fed funds rates an eighth of a point to eight pct for bonds and 6-1/4 pct for funds. Both Nicho and Resler left their end-June prime rate forecast at 7-1/2 pct. The higher rate forecasts reflected a belief that Japanese investors will be less eager to buy U.S. bonds because of fear about further dollar erosion and perhaps in response to U.S. trade sanctions. Yields may have to rise to lure other buyers. ......END-JUNE U.S. INTEREST RATE FORECASTS.... ....................T-bonds..Fed funds..Prime.. Nikko Securities.....8.25......6.15......7.75..

In a speech, Sarney justified his measure as a need to face ""current well known difficulties to obtain foreign loans for the purchase of goods."" The parallel market, although officially tolerated, is technically illegal in Brazil. For the past year, the dollar in the parallel market has sold at between 25 and 100 pct above the official rate. Sarney's decision means Brazilian importers of machinery and industrial equipment can buy dollar currency in the parallel market without having to wait for an official order from the Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade Department (Cacex). Sarney also announced measures to boost exports in an effort to strengthen the country's trade balance and alleviate the risk of a reduction of foreign loans for this sector of the economy. The president authorised the National Foreign Trade Council (CONEX) to resume operating as the ruling body of Brazil's trade policy, with participation of the private sector.

venezuela plans metals investment for 1987-89,iron-steel alum earn,"The Venezuela Guayana Corporation, CVG, which oversees the state steel, iron, aluminum and other industries, will invest 75 billion bolivars in new projects during 1987-89, CVG president Leopoldo Sucre Figarella announced. The investments will go to plant expansion, infrastructure and the extension of hydroelectric facilities in the mineral-rich Guayana region, south of the Orinoco river. Sucre Figarella told a news conference the CVG's 12 companies showed an overall increase of 120 pct in profits, which rose from 1.732 billion bolivars in 1985 to 3.926 billion bolivars last year. Among the best performers was steel company Sidor which earned 1.019 billion bolivars, the first time since 1978 Sidor turned a profit. The gain was made possible in part by the refinancing of 1.619 mln dollars of foreign debt. CVG's three aluminum companies also showed substantial gains. Interalumina, which makes the intermediate material alumina, had an increase in profits from 116 to 217 mln bolivars, Alcasa earned 487 mln bolivars, as compared to 1985's 412 mln and Venalum's profits rose by around half, from 1.042 to 1.504 bln bolivars. Meanwhile, the state iron company Ferrominera saw its profits rise from 156 mln bolivars in 1985 to 204 mln bolivars last year."

Sarney told members of the Council that for Brazil it is a must to recover its annual trade balance surplus to the 12 billion dollars average recorded in 1984 and 1985, and which dropped sharply last year to 8 billion dollars. He attributed the poor performance of Brazil's trade balance in 1986 to protectionist moves by industrialised countries, the fall in the prices of basic goods and the crisis faced by several of Brazil's Third World trade partners."

bank of japan mulls other options to stop yen rise,money-fx yen,"Today's liberalised financial markets are making it extremely difficult for Japan's monetary authorities to prevent the yen's rise against the dollar, but they have several options other than normal intervention, Bank of Japan sources said. A senior central bank official said that such methods as controlling foreign exchange deals and invoking currency swap agreements with other central banks, which have not been invoked since 1978, are all being considered. ""But the time may not be ripe,"" he said. ""In this era of financial liberalisation, it's almost impossible to control the flow of capital in and out of Japan,"" said another senior bank official. But the first official said: ""From a technical viewpoint, the Bank of Japan could activate swap agreements immediately after other central banks involved agreed to do so."" A swap agreement, an exchange of currency between two nations, allows both sides to acquire a ready source of the other's currency in case of need. ""If the Bank invokes such swaps, both parties would announce the decision jointly,"" said the first official. The sources said they believed the limit of currency market intervention may be being reached after they saw recent concerted market action by central banks of major industrial nations was increasingly ineffective in propping up the battered dollar. But intervention is at least an option, they said. Further easing of monetary policy will be very difficult with an official discount rate already at a record low of 2.5 pct, they said. Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita has repeatedly ruled out another rate cut due to fears it could revive inflation. One bank official said he could not deny the possibilty of the Bank of Japan activating currency swap agreements with the U.S. And other central banks, if these banks continue intervening to sell the yen in support of the dollar and run out of their yen cash positions. ""But we don't think they have become short of yen quite yet,"" he said. The bank has established a five billion dlr swap limit with the U.S. Federal Reserve and another 2.5 billion mark and 200 billion yen limit with the West German and Swiss central banks, according to the sources. Foreign exchange dealers estimate the Fed had sold two billion dlrs worth of yen from its own account to support the dollar in New York last week. The central bank sources also said Japan may arrange other currency swap agreements with Britain and France if they find it necessary, but added they are not actually talking with each other towards that end."

s. korea minister to visit u.s. for currency talks,money-fx trade,"South Korea's Finance Minister Chung In-yong will visit U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker next week to discuss U.S. Requests for an appreciation of South Korea's won against the dollar, finance ministry officials said. They said Chung would leave for Washington on Monday to attend the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) Interim Committee meeting and for talks with U.S. Officials on ways of reducing Seoul's trade surplus with Washington. The dates for the Baker-Chung meeting have yet to be set. The IMF committee meeting, scheduled for April 9, is expected to review the resolution reached by the six top industrialised nations in Paris last month calling for newly industrialised countries, such as South Korea and Taiwan, to allow their currencies to rise. The official said Chung is expected to outline Seoul's efforts to increase imports of U.S. Goods and to stress the need for South Korea to maintain a trade surplus in the next few years in order to cut foreign debts totalling some 44.5 billion dlrs. South Korea has ruled out a major revaluation of the won, but is allowing its currency to appreciate slowly. Trade Minister Rha Woong-bae told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this month a sudden won revaluation could result in South Korea running a large trade deficit and being forced to renege on its international debt repayments. The Bank of Korea, the central bank, today fixed the won at a two-year high of 846.90. The won has gained 5.1 pct since the beginning of 1986. South Korea's trade surplus with the U.S. Rose to 7.1 billion dlrs last year from 4.3 billion in 1985."

analysts applaud csr's bold move to sell delhi,acq sugar crude,"CSR Ltd <CSRA.S> has made a bold move in selling its oil and gas interests for almost a billion dlrs and ploughing 150 mln into its traditional sugar business, share analysts said. ""It sounds like a good deal,"" Stuart McKibbin of <A.C. Goode and Co> told Reuters. CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gas interests held in the <Delhi Australia Fund> and would instead sell it to Exxon Corp <XON> unit <Esso Exploration and Production Australia Inc> for 985 mln dlrs. In a twin announcement CSR, already Australia's largest sugar refiner, made a 2.20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct it does not already hold in <Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd>. ""This will be a big shock to the market, which was under the impression that CSR was well down the road to floating Delhi,"" McKibbin said. A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and 300 mln dlrs, but in opting to sell outright, CSR had given itself the cash to practically eliminate its debt and embark on an ambitious expansion programme in its best-performing divisions of sugar and building products, analysts said. CSR not only gets the 985 mln dlrs but also has the right to share equally with Esso any higher returns resulting from an oil price over 20 U.S. Dlrs a barrel in the next two years. Delhi is one of Australia's largest onshore oil producers yielding about six mln barrels a year from the Cooper Basin. Analysts said the deal could net CSR as much as three mln dlrs for every dollar rise in the oil price above 20 dlrs. Neale Goldston-Morris of Sydney broker <Bain and Co Ltd> said the move out of Delhi and investment in the sugar industry was a sensible one but added that it represented the loss of Australian-owned assets to a foreign company. ""The farm they bought back a few years ago is being sold back to the Americans,"" Goldston-Morris said. The Pioneer Sugar investment would make CSR by far the largest player in Australia's 850 mln dlr a year sugar industry and would give it access to some of the best sugar properties and mills in the country, analysts said. They said Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommend acceptance of the bid through which CSR would benefit from the bottom out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices. Sugar prices are forecast to rise to 340 dlrs a tonne next season from an estimated 270 dlrs this year, they said. Selling Delhi meant CSR has finally quit a damaging investment, made in 1981, which has dragged down the company's overall performance, analysts said. CSR last year wrote off more than 550 mln dlrs in losses on what had been a 591 mln U.S. Dlr investment financed entirely from U.S. Dollar debt, they said. ""It was a bad investment for them. They financed it entirely with debt, the currency collapsed on them and then the oil price collapsed on them,"" Owen Evans of Sydney broker <Meares and Philips Ltd> said. Esso not only picked up Delhi's oil and gas output but also gained as much as 300 mln dlrs in transferable tax losses accumulated in exploration allowances and other concessions. Analysts said Esso also gained its first real onshore stake in Australia in its first major diversification from the 50/50 Bass Strait partnership with The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd <BRKN.S>. ""Esso has been very keen to diversify from the Gippsland Basin. They haven't found too much oil in Bass Strait lately and Esso needed a large pool of ongoing production,"" Goldston-Morris said."

Some 840,000 hectares of farmland have been planted with cash crops including sugar cane, peanuts and soybeans, 67,000 ha more than in 1986. The provincial government has increased investment in grain and taken effective measures to combat natural disasters this year, the agency said, but gave no further details."
commodity pacts more oriented towards market,tin sugar grain wheat cocoa coffee rubber,"Consuming countries, chastened by the collapse of International Tin Council (ITC) price support operations in 1985, are insisting more than ever before that commodity pacts reflect the reality of the markets they are serving, a Reuter survey showed. They want price ranges to be more responsive to market trends - to avoid overstimulating output and straining the accords' support operations - and intervention rules that avoid the risk of exports by non-members undermining the pacts. Consumers and producers, mindful of ITC buffer stock losses, have also sought strict conditions for buffer operations. Importers and some key exporting countries have shunned a generalised approach to commodity price stabilisation and prefer to assess each commodity case by case, the survey showed. The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) last week set precise limits on what the Buffer Stock Manager (BSM) could do under the new agreement. It imposed daily and weekly purchase limits, prohibited the BSM from operating on futures markets and stipulated, after consumer insistence, that up to 15 pct of total buffer stock purchases could be of non-member cocoa. This will help prevent lower quality cocoa from Malaysia, the world's fourth largest producer, undermining the market. The cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the Buffer Stock Manager must use when purchasing varying grades. A new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) was adopted earlier this month in Geneva. Importing and exporting countries agreed several changes to make the reference price more responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisions under which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to finance operations. Direct cash contributions from members will fund buffer stock purchases. Bank financing was a particular feature of the failed ITC buffer stock which suffered losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling. Legal wrangles continue. Recent International Coffee Organization (ICO) negotiations in London exemplified the degree to which consumers insist that agreements reflect market reality, commodity analysts said. Consumers and a small group of producers argued that ""objective criteria"" should be used to define export quota shares, which would have meant a reduction in the share of Brazil, the world's leading producer. Brazil wanted to maintain its previous quota share of 30 pct. The talks broke down and, although an ICO executive board meeting starts in London today, delegates and trade sources see chances of any near term negotiations on export quota distribution as remote. International agreements exist for sugar and wheat. These do not have any economic clauses but provide a forum for discussions on possible future economic agreements, collect statistics and draw up market analyses. Analysts said differences between sugar exporting countries have held up any progress towards an accord with economic teeth, while sheer competition between major exporters amid a world grain glut militate against any pact with economic provisions for wheat. An alternative focus for commodity discussions are international study groups, made up of governments with advice from industry, such as those for lead and zinc and rubber. The U.N. Common fund for commodities, with a planned directly contributed capital of 470 mln dlrs, has failed to become operational because neither the U.S. Nor the Soviet Union has ratified it. U.S. Officials in Washington said the U.S. Doubts the fund would be able to fulfil its objectives, citing the lack of widespread support. U.S. Officials in Washington and Malaysian officials in Kuala Lumpur expressed a policy of looking at each commodity pact case by case. U.S. Officials said it has been willing to study individual cases for economically sound, market-oriented commodity accords balancing producer and consumer interests. ""We see little to be gained by attempting to increase the price of a commodity whose long-term trend is downward,"" official Administration policy states. The U.S. Currently belongs to only two international commodity agreements that have economic clauses - the International Coffee Agreement (ICA) and INRA - but it is also a member of the sugar and wheat pacts. The U.S. Did not join the International Cocoa Agreement because it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic and not designed to protect the interests of consuming countries, the State Department said. U.S. Officials singled out the INRA as the one commodity agreement that seems to be working. U.S. Negotiators were successful in getting other members of the pact to agree that the price review and adjustment mechanism of the rubber agreement would accurately reflect market trends and also to continue the accord as a market oriented agreement, U.S. Officials said. Canadian officials in Ottawa also said they have consistently tried to look at membership of commodity pacts on the merits of each case. Malaysian Primary Industries Minister Lim Keng Yaik told Reuters in Kuala Lumpur his country, the world's top producer of rubber, tin and palm oil, decides its participation in international commodity pacts case by case. Malaysia is a member of the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) which produce 65 pct of world tin. The ATPC launched a plan to limit member tin exports to 96,000 tonnes for a year from March to cut the tin surplus to 50,000 from 70,000. Economist in the West German Ministry of Agriculture and delegate to cocoa, wheat and sugar agreements Peter Baron told Reuters in London, ""Agreements with economic clauses to stabilise prices could function if fixed price ranges were close to market reality, if there was full participation by producers and consumers, and if participants were prepared to take their obligations in the framework of the agreement seriously."" But Baron added, ""No real sanctions are available for a country that doesn't stick to its obligations...The German approach is sceptical. We don't think agreements are the best instrument to help developing countries. They were never meant to be a vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is how developing countries often interpret them."" Traditionally Britain has always been supportive of commodity agreements, reflecting its strong links with Third World producing countries. But recently demands for more stringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on the need for ""intellectual honesty"" and ""objective criteria"" have grown. British officials stress the need for commodity pacts to be a two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid. It is now seen as essential that any pacts involving direct market participation through a buffer stock have a high degree of transparency and do not contain the risk of open-ended borrowing that occurred in the tin pact, they said. U.K. Delegates talk of stabilisation and the need for prices to reflect changes in market structure and price trends rather than dictate what prices should be. A Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said Japan urges price realism in commodity pacts, adding high prices inflate supply. A government spokesman in Paris said France is favourable to commodity pacts. France, a large consumer and producer of sugar, favours a sugar pact as long as it reflects the real market situation, particularly regarding stocks. Indonesia's Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja told Reuters in Jakarta: ""These agreements can work as long as the problems are cyclical..But it's another matter when there are structural problems..But we are still committed to commodity agreements as an act of faith."" Nicaraguan External Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca said in London producers cannot afford not to give their backing to commodity agreements. ""The political will is not there on the part of some consumers to make agreements work,"" Martinez Cuenca said. The head of the economics department in the Brazilian Foreign Ministry, Sebastiao do Rego Barros, told Reuters an agreement can be successful if it keeps a link with market reality. If you have an agreement such as coffee with a system of quotas, with a link between prices practised inside the pact and actual market prices, it can work. UNCTAD spokesman Graham Shanley said consuming countries realise steady export earnings enhance developing countries' ability to service debt and mean greater demand for industrialised nations' capital goods."
"csr sells oil/gas interests, bids to extend sugar",crude nat-gas sugar,"CSR Ltd has made a bold move in selling its oil and gas interests for almost a billion dlrs and ploughing 150 mln into its traditional sugar business, share analysts said. CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gas interests held in the Delhi Australia Fund and would instead sell them to Exxon Corp unit Esso Exploration and Production Australia Inc for 985 mln dlrs. In a twin announcement CSR, already Australia's largest sugar refiner, made a 2.20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct it does not already hold in Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd. A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and 300 mln dlrs, but in opting to sell outright CSR had given itself the cash to all but eliminate its debt and embark on an ambitious expansion programme in its best-performing divisions of sugar and building products, analysts said. The Pioneer Sugar investment would give CSR by far the largest stake in Australia's 850 mln dlr a year sugar industry and access to some of the best sugar properties and mills in the country, they said. Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommend acceptance of the bid, through which CSR would benefit from the bottoming out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices."
"bundesbank has not intervened today, dealers",money-fx interest,"The Bundesbank declined to comment on rumours in Tokyo that it was intervening heavily to support the dollar, but dealers here said they had not seen the German central bank in the market all morning. The dollar was quoted at around 1.8040 marks shortly after midday in nervous but quiet trading, up from its 1.7975/85 opening. Spreads against the mark remained around 10 basis points, with some banks quoting only five point spreads. Dealers said spreads would widen and the dollar would move more sharply if the Bundesbank did intervene."
bank of japan to sell 800 billion yen in bills,money-fx interest,"The Bank of Japan will sell tomorrow a total of 800 billion yen worth of financing bills from its holdings to help absorb a projected money market surplus of 1,700 billion yen, money traders said. Of the total, 300 billion yen will yield 3.8992 pct on sales from money houses to banks and securities houses in a 23-day repurchase accord maturing on April 24. The remaining 500 billion yen will yield 3.8990 pct in a 31-day repurchase pact maturing on May 2, they said. The repurchase agreement yields compare with the 3.8750 pct one-month commercial bill discount rate today and the 4.28/11 pct rate on one-month certificates of deposit. Tomorrow's surplus is attributable to excess bank holdings from sales of yen to buy dollars and to huge cash amounts to be redeposited at banks after the current financial year-end today, the traders said. The operation will put the outstanding bill supply at about 3,200 billion yen."
u.s. may drop tariffs if japan opens - yeutter,trade yen dlr,"The U.S. Is willing to drop tariffs on Japanese electronic imports if Japan shows it will abide by an agreemement opening its markets to American goods, U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said in a TV interview. ""But there has to be a clear indication that they are willing to act,"" he said. Yeutter said difficulties in the Japanese economy caused by the U.S. Tariffs and the yen's rise against the dollar are problems ""they have brought on themselves."" The dollar fell to 40-year lows against the yen today. ""Certainly the movement of the yen is causing some economic turmoil in Japan,"" he said. ""My only response is that we have gone through about five years with the dollar going in just the opposite direction. Although I can sympathise, it's occurred for only a few weeks or months in Japan."" The tarriffs, announced on Friday by President Reagan, will affect about 300 million dlrs worth of products, only a tiny fraction of Japan's total exports to the U.S. Even so, Reagan's decision ""doesn't give us any joy. We don't want to take retaliatory action here if we don't have to,"" Yeutter said. Yeutter said the meetings scheduled next month in Washington between Reagan and Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone will include ""some difficult items on the agenda."" Japan has failed to implement two parts of a three-part semiconductor agreement, Yeutter said. Japan has stopped dumping chips in the U.S. But it has failed to open its domestic markets to U.S.-made chips and has failed to end predatory pricing in Third World countries, undercutting U.S. Products, he said."

csce restructures coffee futures daily limits,coffee sugar cocoa,"The Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange has expanded the normal daily trading limit in Coffee ""C"" contracts to 6.0 cents a lb, from the previous 4.0 cents, effective today, the CSCE said. The new daily limits apply to all but the two nearby positions, currently May and July, which trade without limits. In addition, the 6.0 cent limit can be increased to 9.0 cents a lb if the first two limited months both make limit moves in the same direction for two consecutive sessions, according to the CSCE announcement. Before the rule change today, the CSCE required two days of limit moves in the first three restricted contracts before expanding the daily trading limit. Under new guidelines, if the first two restricted deliveries move the 6.0 cent limit for two days the Exchange will expand the limit. The expanded 9.0 cent limit will remain in effect until the settling prices on both of the first two limited months has not moved by more than the normal 6.0 cent limit for other contracts in two successive trading sessions, the CSCE said."
kansas exchange hits cftc position limit plan,grain wheat,"The Kansas City Board of Trade, KCBT, has asked federal futures regulators to modify a proposal to raise the Chicago Board of Trade's, CBT, speculative position limits on wheat futures contracts, saying the plan would put the the Kansas exchange ""at a serious competitive disadvantage."" The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, last month proposed raising CBT wheat speculative limits to 1,200 contracts all months net from 600 contracts, and to 900 contracts for any single month from 600 contracts. At the same time, CFTC proposed leaving KCBT's wheat speculative position limits unchanged. ""Higher limits for CBT wheat than for KCBT wheat would significantly impair the KCBT's ability to compete with the CBT for speculative interest,"" Michael Braude, president of the Kansas exchange, said in a letter to CFTC. A CFTC spokesman said the commission took into account open interest affected by existing speculative limits in proposing to raise CBT's limits. KCBT said the CFTC proposal would reduce hedging efficiency, constrain growth of intermarket spreading and of the exchange's wheat options contract and impair its ability to attract large speculators. The Kansas City exchange asked the commission to amend its proposal to change the limits for KCBT wheat to the exact same bushel amount as specified for CBT wheat. CFTC will consider public comments on the proposal until June 3."
exxon <xon> oil and gas production rose in 1986,crude nat-gas,"Exxon Corp said in its annual report that it raised production in 1986 although it did not replace all oil and gas produced. The company said that it added about four pct to production bringing it to 1.8 mln bpd, the highest level since 1979, based largely on increased production of oil overseas but additions to its reserves from new discoveries and reserve acquisitions did not replace all of the oil and gas produced. The company said that the average price for oil and gas declined 41 pct in 1986 from the previous year sparking a 38 pct decline in its earnings from exploration and production. Exxon's earnings from exploration and production in 1986 fell to 3.1 billion dlrs from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985. Exxon said that its principal gains in production came from the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, the North Sea, Malaysia and from oil sands in Canada. Exxon also said that it acquired 11.2 mln acres for expoloration spread over 10 countries including the U.S, Europe and the Far East. But capital expenditures for exploration and production were cut to 4.6 billion dlrs from 7.6 billion the previous year and further reductions were expected in 1987. Exxon said that its net share of crude oil and natural gas liquids produced from offshore fields in the North Sea reached a new high of 422,000 bpd. The light, sweet crudes produced from these North Sea fields also gave the company trading gains as Exxon was able to sell much of this crude and replace it with cheaper, lower quality crude oil for its refineries which have been upgraded over the past several years. The trading gains and lower acquisition costs gave Exxon more of a spread in its refinery operations and added to earnings gains from refining and marketing. Exxon said earnings from refining and marketing operations rose to nearly two billion dlrs in 1986, up from 872 mln dlrs in 1985. The company said petroleum sales slipped slightly to 4.043 mln barrels per day from 4.082 mln bpd in 1985 while crude runs rose to 3.0 mln bpd from 2.9 mln bpd the previous year. Exxon's refinery operations benefited from a three year 500 mln dlr upgrading program to its Baytown, Texas refinery completed last October and an 850 mln dlr upgrading project in Rotterdam both of which emphasize utilizing lower grade crudes to extract higher proportions of light products."
u.s. commerce secretary sees higher gnp growth,gnp lei,"Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said a 0.7 pct rise in February's index of leading indicators pointed to stronger economic growth in the first half of 1987. In a statement commenting on the rise last month after a 0.5 pct January decline, Baldrige noted the leading index was rising at an 8.0 pct annual rate in the six months to the end of February. ""Based on past relationships, that gain is consistent with stepped up growth in real GNP during the first half of 1987,"" Baldrige said."
dutch money market debt eases in week,money-fx interest,"Loans and advances from the Dutch Central Bank to the commercial banks fell 1.01 billion guilders to 9.5 billion guilders in the week ending March 30, the Bank's weekly return showed. Dealers said payments by the Dutch state, partly in the form of civil service wages, had outweighed payments to the State, causing the money market deficit to ease. The Treasury's account with the Bank dropped 960 mln guilders to 6.5 billion guilders. Liabilities in gold or foreign currency rose 200 mln to 11.9 billion guilders. Dealers said it was more likely that the alteration in this item on the weekly return indicated normal commercial foreign exchange business rather than intervention by the Central Bank. The Bank itself does not disclose information on intervention. Seasonal variation brought bank notes in circulation up 190 mln guilders to 29.7 billion guilders. Total gold and currency reserves rose 173 mln guilders to 56.4 billion guilders. Call money and period rates were barely changed in the week. Today all were traded at 5-3/8 to 5-1/2 pct."
kansas legislator predicts eep wheat to soviets,grain wheat,"Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., predicted the Reagan administration within the next ten days to two weeks will offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union under the Export Enhancement Program, EEP. Roberts made the comment at a press conference held by Republican members of the House Agriculture Committee. He did not say on what he based the comment, but an aide said Roberts had been in touch with top Republican officials recently. The possibility of an expansion of EEP to include wheat to Moscow has been rumored for some time, and some industry sources believe a decision on the issue will be made by the Reagan administration before Secretary of State George Shultz goes to Moscow in April."
exxon <xon> gains due to streamlined operations,earn crude,"Exxon Corp said that 1986's 15 pct increase in earnings per share to 7.42 dlrs a share were partially based on its streamlined operations which compensated for the weakness in its exploration earnings and the lowest crude oil prices in a decade. Exxon said economies introduced in its operations from reductions in personnel and other savings, such as reductions in exploration expenses, were reflected in an 880 mln dlr reduction in consolidated operating costs from 1985. The company said its more efficient operations would be necessary to offset more adverse oil market conditions ahead. The company also said that its share repurchase plan contributed to the per share gains over 1985. In a breakdown of costs, Exxon said that operating expenses slipped to 9.2 billion dlrs in 1986 from 9.7 billion dlrs the previous year and exploration expenses, including dry holes, slipped back to 1.2 billion dlrs from 1.5 billion dlrs over the same period as the number of wells drilled was lower. The company was also able to use lower interest rates to reduce its interest expenses to 614 mln dlrs in 1986 from 627 mln dlrs the previous year. Exxon said that the ratio of debt to capital was cut by 1.6 pct in 1986 from the previous year to 19 pct. On December 31, 1986 Exxon's total debt of 7.87 billion dlrs was down slightly from the previous year's 7.9 billion dlrs and long term debt stood at 4.3 billion dlrs, down from 4.8 billion dlrs in 1985. Exxon's policy of repurchasing shares on the market for its treasury also contributed to earnings results by a reduction of shares to 722.6 mln shares from 754.1 mln shares the previous year."
weather hurting yugoslav wheat - usda report,grain wheat corn,"Unfavorable late winter weather conditions in the main wheat growing areas of Yugoslavia indicate dimmed prospects for the emerging winter wheat crop, the U.S. embassy's agricultural officer in Belgrade said. The officer, who travelled through an area from Belgrade to Subotica, said in a field report dated March 27 the wheat crop had been set back at least three weeks because of a cold spell that followed a period of warm weather. He said unseasonably warm weather in late February that brought the wheat crop out of winter dormancy early was followed by three weeks of unusually cold weather. Damaging effects were seen in the fields, most of which show stands with a yellow-brown cast indicating extensive leaf and possible root damage from repeated freezings, he said. The report said that since much of the early growth in February was from late seeding rather than from normal development, his view was that the damage may be more extensive than some local observers say. The most seriously affected fields were late-seeded fields on normal maize soils. Stands in these fields were thin and chances of recovery appeared less favorable, he said. However, he said soil moisture conditions were favorable and many of the fields had already been top-dressed, which would aid recovery."

When asked to clarify comments by Rep. Pat Roberts of Kansas that the administration would soon offer Export Enhancement wheat to the Soviet Union Lyng said, ""well it won't be today,"" and then added, ""we have no official comment one way or the other."" Lyng would not comment on whether a wheat subsidy offer to the USSR is under more active consideration at the USDA, saying that any remarks by him would be tantamount to an official announcement and could be construed inappropriately."

winter weather hurts east german grain - usda,grain wheat,"Shifts from mild to very cold weather in East Germany damaged winter barley and late sown winter wheat in central regions and barley north of Berlin, the U.S. agricultural officer in East Berlin said. In a field report, the officer said indications were that winter kill might well be more than 100,000 hectares compared with 38,000 last year. He said the damage was probably more limited in southern and central regions and most widespread in the north. Damage was most severe on plants above the ground where little or no snow cover was present, he added. The officer said heavy frosts at night followed by sunshine during the day led to some heaving, particularly for well developed plants and for winter barley. Furthermore, as the ground surface thawed, some standing water occurred in the fields. The officer said repairing damage will probably call for special measures this spring in fields with damaged plants and where stands are thin. Harrowing, as well as well-timed applications of nitrogen, will be necessary, he added."
traders expect sharp drop in u.s. corn acreage,grain corn,"Grain trade analysts expect a sharp drop in corn acreage, with most expecting a more modest decline in soybeans, in the U.S. Agriculture Department, USDA, plantings intentions report due out at 1500 est (2100 gmt). The average trade guess for 1987 planted corn acreage was 66.06 mln acres, ranging from 60.7 to 69.0 mln, all well below the 76.67 mln planted last year due to improved incentives by the USDA for farmers to retire acres. Corn acres totalled only 60.22 mln in 1983, when the PIK program was introduced. The average soybean planted acreage quesstimate was 59.49 mln, ranging from 58.0 to 63.0 mln and compared with the 61.48 mln planted in 1986 With substantial grain stocks, less interest was expressed among analysts in the USDA stocks report also scheduled today."

Syria has bought around 320,000 tonnes of soft French wheat since the beginning of the 1986/87 campaign, of which only 121,000 tonnes had been exported by the end of last month. The country also bought around 30,000 tonnes of EC soft wheat 12 days ago at 80 to 81 dlrs a tonne, fob, they said."
csce alters rules on trading limits,coffee sugar cocoa,"The Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange amended regulations governing expanded trading limits on coffee, cocoa and sugar contracts to provide uniformity. Effective today, the exchange will permit normal daily price limits in those commodities to expand whenever the first two limited contract months move the limit in the same direction for two consecutive sessions. The normal daily limits will be reinstated once the first two limited deliveries close by less than the normal limit for two successive trading days. Previously exchange rules required the first three limited months to move the limit in coffee and cocoa. It had required the first two limited sugar deliveries to make such moves for three consecutive sessions."
"u.s. distillate, gasoline inventories seen lower",crude gas heat,"Tonight's American Petroleum Institute weekly inventory report is expected to show moderate drawdowns in distillates and gasoline stocks for the week ended March 27, analysts and traders said. They said they expect gasoline stocks to fall three mln barrels or less and heating oil inventories to drop between 1.3 and four mln barrels. Some analysts see crude stocks falling by as much as six mln barrels, while others think they could go up as much as 3.5 mln barrels. Crude oil runs are expected to be unchanged from the previous week or slightly higher or lower. For the week ended March 20, the API said gasoline stocks fell 2.7 mln barrels. Mosts analysts expect a modest draw for the week ended March 27. They said stocks could fall between 700,000 and three mln barrels. Some said there is also a chance gasoline stocks will be unchanged. API said distillate stocks dropped four mln barrels for the week ended March 20. Analysts and traders generally predict a similar or smaller depletion for last week. They said stock levels could drop 1.3 to four mln barrels. The analysts attribute product stockdraws to seasonal factors but they said crude direction is harder to call. Crude inventories rose 8.5 mln barrels in the week ended March 20, API said. Analysts are looking for build of between 3.5 mln barrels to a six mln barrel draw for the week ended March 27. API reported the amount of refinery capacity utilized up three pct for the week ended March 20. Analysts said utilization could have remained unchanged, or rose or fell by less than one pct for the week ended March 27. Moderate product stockdraws would strengthen the market slightly, analysts said. But bullish expectations are already partially reflected in today's gains, they added."
china crop weather summary -- usda/noaa,grain rice,"Moderate to heavy rain continued over early double-crop rice areas in eastern Guangxi, Guanghdong, eastern Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Zhejiang in the week ended March 28, the Joint Agricultural Weather Facility of the U.S. Agriculture and Commerce Departments said. In its International Weather and Crop summary, the agency said The moisture lessened the need for irrigation. Moisture for early rice planting is adequate to abundant in most areas, and inundative rain in Guangdong and southern Jiangxi may have washed out some rice fields requiring replanting. Light showers in southern Sichuan increased topsoil moisture for corn planting, which likely is off to a slow start due to earlier dryness, it said. In the North China Plain, dry weather covered winter wheat in the vegetative stage, and rain is needed to meet increasing crop moisture requirements, it said. Weekly temperatures in the North China Plain were near normal, the agency noted."

usda again extends farm operating plan deadline,grain rice cotton,"The U.S. Agriculture Department said it has extended until April 17 the date by which Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation county offices must determine eligibility of individuals or other entities for payments under 1987 farm programs. Jerome Sitter, director of ASCS's Cotton, Grain and Rice Price Support Division, said the decision meant farmers have until April 17 to file a farm operating plan indicating how many persons would be involved in their farming operations. Earlier this year USDA extended the deadline to April 1 from March 1, Sitter said. ASCA Administrator Milton Hertz said in a statement that the extension was necessary because of heavy workloads at county ASCS offices. Hertz said ASCS county officials ""have had to make a large number of eligibility determinations for individuals and other entities, such as corporations and partnerships, in preparation for imposing the 50,000-dlr-per-entity cap."" ""These offices already had a very heavy workload due to the large number of applications for both the 1987 farm programs and the Conservation Reserve Program,"" Hertz said."

grain reports improve u.s. farm outlook-analysts,grain corn oilseed soybean,"The U.S. grain planting intentions and stocks reports bear optimistic news for U.S agriculture, a grain analyst on a Chicago Board of Trade panel said. The decline in intended soybean acreage and lower stocks are ""the first report we've had for a long time that shows any optimism for anybody,"" said John ""Bud"" Frazier, grain analyst and executive vice president for Balfour MacLaine, Inc. ""I'm really excited about it,"" Frazier said. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said farmers intend to plant 67.6 mln acres of corn, down from 76.7 mln planted last year, and 56.8 mln acres of soybeans, down from 61.5 mln. The report showed March 1 stocks of 1.4 billion bushels of soybeans, 8.3 billion bushels of corn, and 2.3 billion bushels of wheat, all below trade guesses. Frazier was joined by Susan Hackmann, senior grain analyst with AgriAnalysis, and Mark Meyer, a grain analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers, Inc., on a Chicago Board of Trade panel to discuss the reports. Frazier said the stocks reports in particular were friendly for the market, and soybean prices would jump three to five cents a bushel ""if the bell rang right now."" ""We're getting our disappearance up. We have less (corn and soybeans) than we thought we had,"" he said, noting that hog and poultry production is up. ""We're seeing low prices generate some interest in demand,"" said Meyer, adding that feed use was up 13 pct last quarter and 15 pct in the preceding quarter. However, Hackmann said production could continue to exceed consumption. She noted that most of the reductions in soybean acres came in southeastern states, where yields are usually low. ""We have the potential for record breaking soybean yields this year, (which) will temper the enthusiasm on tomorrow's opening,"" she said. Hackmann said record corn yields also are possible, and the crop could reach 7.1 billion bushels, which would be down from last year's 8.25 billion bushels. ""We'll need very good disappearance next year to reduce stocks,"" she said. The USDA estimated disappearance last year at 6.7 billion bushels. Hackmann said the stocks report was positive for the long term, ""But we still have a long way to go to bring stocks down to where we could start rebuilding prices."" Frazier also cautioned that the soybean acreage report could prompt farmers to change their plans and plant more soybeans. The panelists agreed that the reports should discourage talk of revising the 1985 farm bill. ""There seems to be no desire ... to change the farm law we're working under today, and this report should reinforce that,"" Frazier said. ""We are seeing the program beginning to work,"" said Meyer."
china official condemns government grain policy,grain corn cotton,"The grain output of a major Chinese grain-producing province is not increasing, because farmers lack incentives, production costs are rising, storage facilities are poor and there is not enough state investment in grain, the province's vice-governor said. The China Daily quoted Yang Jike, vice-governor of Anhui, as saying farmers could earn twice as much growing cotton as they could growing grain, and three times as much growing cash crops like flax. He said production costs had risen to 40 pct of farmers' earnings, from 20 pct in 1982, and lower investment had caused the area of irrigated land to fall. Yang said investment in agriculture fell in 1985 to 9.9 pct of the province's total investment, from 26 pct in 1978. He said an estimated 1.5 billion yuan worth of grain was hit by mildew or rot in state granaries every year, and a further 1.5 mln tonnes was eaten annually by rats. He said government measures to deal with the problem dealt with trifles, rather than the essentials. He called for more investment in grain production, an immediate ban on illegal use of or damage to farmland and a reversal of what he called the tendency to rely on grain imports. The New China News Agency quoted Zhang Yan, a delegate to the National People's Congress, attacking grain policy. He said the government had cut agricultural investment to three to four pct from 11 pct. ""With the abundance of grain and cotton in the past few years, some people got carried away, relaxing their attention to grain and cotton production,"" he said. On Saturday, vice-premier Tian Jiyun said China aimed to be self-sufficient in grain. Now it exports corn from the northeast, but it imports wheat. ""Grain consumption is rising every year. Even if we reach the 1987 target of (405 mln tonnes), it cannot be considered adequate,"" Tian said."

seipp says german interest rates should fall,interest gnp money-fx,"The Bundesbank should take further steps to reduce German interest rates to protect the mark from further appreciation and to persuade investors to bring long-term yields lower, Commerzbank AG <CBKG.F> management board chairman Walter Seipp said. But he told the bank's annual news conference this did not mean a cut in leading interest rates, rather a reduction in money market rates through bringing the allocation rates down for Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements. ""Leading interest rates are not the decisive rates,"" he said. ""The money market rates are the important ones."" Seipp said the Bundesbank should move away from allocating money market liquidity at a fixed 3.8 pct as it has in recent tender allocations. An easier monetary policy would not mean a loss of credibility for the Bundesbank in its containment of monetary growth. A fall in short rates would make the public aware of the high yields in bonds and lead to a longer-term capital formation, braking the expansion of money supply. ""Thus, you can have lower rates and also a normalisation of monetary growth both at the same time,"" he added. Seipp said there were no grounds to paint too black a picture of the German economy, since company profitability had improved over recent years and domestic oriented firms were profiting from cheaper imports because of the rise in the mark. Growth this year should be at least one pct, he said, describing the downturn in production in the first months as a false start, unrepresentative of the rest of the year. After an economic contraction in the first quarter, the economy should show an uptrend in the last three. ""We don't believe that the economy has tipped over, but see it more as a 'growth dip,'"" Seipp said. But Seipp also called for support for growth from fiscal policy, saying the top rate of income and corporate tax should be brought down to 49 pct. The current peak rate is 56 pct. The additional tax cuts brought forward to next January were no substitute for support for growth. Seipp added the federal government should make ""further courageous steps to decrease the state's proportion of the German economy and to increase its flexibility."""

taiwan sees sharp decline in shipbreaking,ship iron-steel,"Taiwan's shipbreaking industry is expected to decline sharply this year despite the boom in 1986 because of keener competition from South Korea and China, the rising Taiwan dollar and U.S. Import curbs on steel products, industry sources said. Last year, Taiwanese breakers demolished a record 344 vessels totalling 3.69 million light displacement tons (ldt), up on 165 of 2.97 million ldt in 1985, Lin Chung-jung, a Taiwan Shipbreaking Industry Association (TSIA) spokesman, told Reuters. China scrapped vessels of some 1.1 mln ldt last year while South Korea demolished ships of 910,000 ldt, he said. Yao Liu, president of Chi Shun Hwa Steel Co, a leading shipbreaker and steel producer in Kaohsiung, told Reuters, ""We expect to scrap fewer ships this year because of an expected decline in our steel product exports."" Lin said many breakers predicted a 20 pct decline in scrapping operations this year due to falling demand from the U.S., Japan and Southeast Asia for Taiwanese steel. Taiwan agreed last year to voluntarily limit its steel product exports to the U.S. To 120,000 tonnes in the first half of 1987 from about 260,000 tonnes in the first half of 1986, a Taiwan Steel and Iron Association official said. Yao said the rising Taiwan dollar means Taiwan's steel exports are more expensive than South Korea's and China's. The Taiwan dollar has strengthened by some 16 pct against the U.S. Unit since September 1985 and some bankers and economists said it could appreciate to 32 to the U.S. Dollar by the end of the year from 34.23 today, Yao said. In comparison, the won rose by about five pct and yuan remained stable during the same period, he added. ""We have lost some orders to South Korea and mainland China because foreign importers have switched their purchases,"" he said. Taiwan's steel exports to the U.S., Japan and Southeast Asia slipped to 148,000 tonnes in the first two months of 1987 from about 220,000 tonnes a year earlier, the Taiwan Steel and Iron Association official said. He said he expected further declines in later months but did not give figures."

german call money drops back at month start,money-fx interest,"Call money rates fell to 3.85/95 pct from five pct yesterday in moderate trading as month end tightness disappeared and operators took positions for April. Dealers said they expected rates to remain within a 3.70 to four pct range this month. A minor tax payment period on behalf of customers mid-month, the long Easter weekend and pension payments were unlikely to tighten rates significantly. Next Wednesday, 14.9 billion marks are leaving the system on the expiry of a securities repurchase pact. But dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to fully replace the outflow with a new tender at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct. Commerzbank AG's management board chairman Walter Seipp called on the Bundesbank to reduce interest rates to protect the mark through bringing the allocation rate for securities repurchase agreements down. But dealers said the Bundesbank was unlikely to ease credit policies at the moment. There was little domestic and foreign pressure for lower rates and no signs of a change. Yesterday one or two large West German banks effectively drained the domestic money market of liquidity in order to achieve higher rates from their overnight deposits, dealers said. Bundesbank figures showed banks held an average daily 50.7 billion marks in minimum reserves at the central bank over the first 30 days of March, the exact requirement needed just one day before the end of the month. Actual holdings on Monday were 42.0 billion marks. Because rates soared to the level of the Lombard emergency funding rate yesterday, banks fell back on the loan facility to draw down a high 5.3 billion marks in an attempt to meet Bundesbank needs, the data showed."

"precious metals climate improving, says montagu",gold silver,"The climate for precious metals is improving with prices benefiting from renewed inflation fears and the switching of funds from dollar and stock markets, brokers Samuel Montagu and Co Ltd said.

In March the gold/silver ratio narrowed from 74 to less than 67. The supply/demand position has improved in the past year, and despite a silver market surplus, the quantity of silver is modest enough to be absorbed by investors, it added. The report said the firmness in oil prices was likely to continue in the short term.

kenyan minister forecasts economic expansion,gnp coffee bop,"Kenya's economy will continue to expand this year and the government will do more to encourage investment by foreign firms and the local private sector, Planning Minister Robert Ouko said. He told a news conference that the government would soon create a special bureau to expedite processing of investment applications by local and foreign investors. Praising the role of multinational companies and local entrepreneurs in Kenya's economy, the minister promised to maintain a close working contact with the private sector. The economy grew by 5.3 pct last year, up from 4.1 pct in 1985, Ouko said. This was owing to high prices for the country's coffee exports, low oil prices, low inflation and rising real incomes, he added. ""Despite rising petroleum prices and falling coffee prices, Kenya's economy is still expected to improve in 1987,"" the planning minister said. ""High aggregate demand arising from low inflation, trade liberalisation and disciplined financial management are expected to increase output in the manufacturing sector,"" he said. Agriculture would expand significantly if favourable weather continued and farmers responded to producer price rises announced in February, the minister added. Kenyan farmers are anxiously awaiting the arrival of the long rainy season, which is due to start about now. Ouko said the production of Kenya's main cash crops increased during the second half of last year. Coffee deliveries to the state-run Coffee Board of Kenya rose 17 pct and tea deliveries rose four pct during the period, he said. Ouko paid tribute to the private sector for its contribution to the economy and promised to improve government cooperation with businessmen by maintaining regular contact with them. ""I wish to pay tribute to the private sector for its contribution to the economy in 1986 and challenge it to maintain the same spirit this year ... The manufacturing sector grew by an estimated 5.8 pct in 1986, in line with the same period the previous year,"" he said. Ouko said the ""one stop"" bureau was intended to stimulate investment and cut the time and bureacracy currently involved in processing applications. The planning minister presented a review of the Kenyan economy during the second half of 1986 which showed inflation falling to 4.3 pct from 10.2 a year earlier. This was owing to higher agricultural production and the Kenyan shilling's relative strength against other major currencies, the report said. The average exchange rate was 16.23 shillings per U.S. Dlr last year, a fall of only 1.2 pct from 16.432 in 1985. The half yearly report said exports increased about 30 pct in July-December 1986, while imports rose by only six pct during the period. This gave Kenya an overall balance of payments surplus of 780 mln Kenya shillings (48 mln dlrs) during the period, compared with a 1.4 billion shilling (87 mln dlr) deficit in the second half of 1985, it said."

hog report shows more hogs on farms,hog livestock,"The USDA quarterly hogs and pig report yesterday showed more hogs on U.S. farms compared to last year as profitability resulting from low grain prices encouraged producers to step up production, analysts said. Most analysts seemed to agree with Chicago Mercantile Exchange floor traders that the report will be viewed as bearish to pork futures and futures prices may open sharply lower today. Some traders and analysts expect limit declines in nearby contracts, with spillover selling likely in cattle. University of Missouri agronomist Glen Grimes said,""The report shows that hog producers have responded to a very desirable feeding ratio that they enjoyed for the past 10 months."" Shearson Lehman analyst Chuck Levitt said hog futures prices are above producers' break even points. Even if futures fell the daily limit of 1.50 cents today, producers could still lock in a profit, which increases the likelihood of heavy selling pressure today. ""We have not had a period of profitability of this magnitude since last summer,"" Levitt said. ""In fact, hog operations on many mixed livestock/grain enterprises have been so profitable that it actually enabled some farmers to get back on their feet and refinance their loans just based on the hog operation alone."" Levitt said the weight breakdown in the report also was negative, in that some lead time was anticipated before the slaughter increased from the previous year. We expected farmers to increase hog operations, but we didn't expect this degree of expansion to show up in a 10-state spring report, Levitt added. High hog corn ratios (the number of bushels of corn that could be bought for 100 lbs of hog) and the resulting increased profits, encouraged farmers and confinement operations to increase production starting late last year. Analysts also noted that part of the increase in the hog herd resulted from a revision of the December report and without the revision, the March report might have been very close to average expectations. Robin Fuller of Agri Analysis said the USDA made a major upward revision of 105,000 head in the size of the breeding herd in the December 1 report. So the December report was more bearish than initially indicated. But Fuller, as well as other analysts, expected the report to be less negative on deferred futures contracts. Distant contracts are already at a sharp discount to cash because traders anticipated high farrowing intentions, she noted. Discounts in the October and December contracts take into consideration a six to seven pct increase in March/May farrowing intentions, which was borne out in the March 1 report, Fuller said. Grimes said, ""As far as the distant months are concerned, if our first quarter pig crop is up only six pct and under 60 lb inventories actually up only five pct, it would take a tremendous discount in price for each percent increase for us to push down to the prices that the current futures show for the July and August period."" Jerry Abbenhaus, analyst for AGE Clearing noted that distant futures prices are already 15 to 20 dlrs lower than they were last summer. ""If cash hogs at the 7-markets last year averaged 61 dlrs during July, that doesn't mean hogs have to be 15 dlrs cheaper this year because we have six pct more numbers,"" he said."
thyssen sees up to 20 pct lower sales in 1986/87,earn iron-steel,"Thyssen AG <THYH.F> expects a fall of between 15 and 20 pct in consolidated turnover in 1986/87, chief executive Dieter Spethmann said. He told journalists the exact decline would depend on dollar developments. The Thyssen group did over 50 pct of its business outside West Germany. Spethmann made no comment on 1986/87 group earnings. World group net profit fell to 370.1 mln marks in the year ended September 1986 from 472.4 mln a year earlier on group sales which fell to 40.00 billion marks from a previous 44.32 billion. Last week Spethmann told the annual meeting Thyssen expected to post a good profit in 1986/87 despite expected losses in the mass steel-making operations this year. Spethmann said engineering turnover would not be lower this year, but lower steel prices would result in a drop in steel turnover and sales volume. This would also affect Thyssen's trading operations, he said. Spethmann also categorically denied a magazine article published this week which spoke of a dispute between him and Heinz Kriwet, management board chairman of Thyssen Stahl AG, over planned job cuts in steel plants in the Ruhr area."

It said its first estimate of planting intentions indicated cuts of 15 to 20 pct in plantings in the northern region of Picardy and the Paris Basin, which harvested 192,000 ha last year. In the centre-west region of Poitou-Charentes, plantings were estimated four to seven pct up on last year's harvested 244,000 ha. Planting intentions in the south-east ranged between nine pct less and two pct more than last year's 125,000 ha. In the south-west the AGPM said producers intended to plant a similar area to last year's 671,100 harvested hectares, provided water supplies are adequate in the Midi-Pyrenees region after the last two years of drought. Meanwhile, the oilseed plant breeding association, AMSOL, said sunflower plantings in France this year are indicated at between 900,000 and 950,000 ha against 829,000 harvested last year, while soya plantings are indicated at 80,000 ha against last year's harvested 48,000."

"u.s., argentina settle soyproduct case - yeutter",soybean oilseed,"U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said the United States and Argentina have settled a case brought by the U.S. soybean crushing industry alleging unfair subsidies to Argentina's crushing industry. Speaking to an Agribusiness Education forum here late yesterday, Yeutter said the case was resolved at a meeting with Argentine Agriculture Secretary Ernesto Figuerras during a trade ministers' meeting in New Zealand last week. Under a verbal understanding between the two ministers, Argentina will soon abolish export taxes on soybeans and products, U.S. and Argentine officials said. The U.S. case brought by the U.S. National Soybean Processors Association alleged Argentina, through differential export taxes, implicitly subsidized domestic soybean crushers. The U.S. crushing industry, in its complaint under Section 301 of trade law, said higher Argentine export taxes on soybeans than on products encourage the export of products and represented an unfair trade practice. Yeutter told Figuerras that all agencies of the U.S. government supported the U.S. complaint and unless Argentina took steps to eliminate the taxes, the United States would consider taking further action in the case, U.S. and Argentine officials said. An Argentine official here said no timetable was given for removal of the Argentine export taxes."

Shultz' statement two weeks ago that he would not stand in the way of a wheat subsidy offer under the Export Enhancement Program, EEP, coupled with the announcement of his visit to Moscow, was interpreted by many grain trade representatives here as a clear signal that the Reagan administration was preparing an offer. Administration officials -- in and out of the U.S. Agriculture Department -- have been extremely tight-lipped about the prospects of a subsidy offer. But USDA officials for the most part have abandoned the contention the proposal is dormant, suggesting that an offer, while not a ""done deal,"" is a live possibility. Prominent U.S. grain trade representatives -- many of whom asked not to be identified -- continue to maintain that an offer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent. Others, who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible, are saying they would not rule one out. Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., yesterday went so far as to predict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten days to two weeks. Aides to Roberts said he had spoken to Republican leaders who had been in contact with administration officials. Richard Fritz, director of international marketing at U.S. Wheat Associates, said he was confident an export enhancement offer would be made by the middle of this month. Fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would end up being close to the offer Washington made Peking earlier this year when USDA approved subsidies to China of around 36 dlrs per tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat. Some grain trade representatives say a four-mln-tonne wheat subsidy offer might help stimulate more Soviet purchases of U.S. corn and open the door to U.S. sales of soybeans. As ever, one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat deal would appear to be price. Last summer the administration took the controversial step of offering the Soviets subsidized wheat -- but were embarrassed when Moscow spurned the proposal on the grounds that the 15-dlr-per-tonne subsidy still left U.S. wheat prices far above world market prices. The administration's decision to set the subsidy level up front instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be a means of controlling the price while attempting to dampen criticism, grain trade sources said. Nonetheless, the pricing procedure did not prevent Shultz from saying the Soviets were ""chortling"" because Washington was offering Soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available to U.S. housewives. The conventional wisdom among grain trade representatives here is that a general warming of relations between the two countries since last summer, combined with continued hard times in the U.S. grain belt, would favor a subsidy offer. In addition, the USSR has made it clear it would consider buying U.S. wheat if it were priced more competitively. However, observers have not forgotten the circumstances surrounding the administration's announcement of the wheat subsidy offer last summer. Up until the time of the announcment, congressional and industry leaders were led to believe the White House had decided to expand the Export Enhancement Program to include not only the Soviets, but also a much broader list of countries. Instead, the administration scaled back the offer to include only the Soviets. That last-minute change of heart adds a measure of uncertainty even to the predictions of those most convinced that the administration will not now pass up the opportunity to sell four mln tonnes of wheat to the Soviet Union."

u.s. said promised bulk of maize export to spain,corn sorghum grain,"The U.S. Has been promised a near monopoly of maize exports to Spain from third countries guaranteed under an agreement with the European Community, an EC official said. The official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters that the guarantee was given in an unpublished clause of the agreement. Under the accord, which began in January, third countries were guaranteed access for the next four years for two mln tonnes a year of maize to the Spanish market, as well as 300,000 tonnes of sorghum. However, the official said the U.S. Had been assured that almost all the exports would be reserved for its traders. The EC Commission is to ask member states to agree either a tender system to fix reduced import levies for the maize or to authorise direct imports by the Spanish intervention board. EC sources noted that under a tender system maize from outside the U.S. Would sometimes be offered on more favourable terms than that from the U.S. No Commission spokesman was immediately available for comment."
argentine corn sales to ussr lower - usda report,corn grain,"Total corn sales by Argentina to the Soviet Union are only 1.5 to 1.8 mln tonnes, with delivery spread out from March to June, the U.S. Agriculture Department's Counselor in Buenos Aires said in a field report. The report, dated March 27, said many sources have stated that the Soviet Union was initially interested in purchasing 2.3 mln tonnes lof corn from Argentina. However, Soviet purchases from the United States have tended to displace additional Argentine purchases, the report said. The USDA has to date reported USSR purchases of 2.6 mln tonnes of U.S. corn for delivery in the current U.S.-USSR grain agreement year, which ends this September 30, it said."

"lawson wants sterling around 1.60 dlrs, 2.90 mks",stg money-fx,"U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said he wanted sterling to stay roughly where it was, specifying a rate of around 2.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs. He told the National Economic Development Council that the recent Paris meeting of major industrialised nations had agreed on the need for exchange rate stability. There was now a ""reasonable alignment of currencies"" and the U.K. Government intended to keep sterling at about its present level, he said. That meant around 2.90 marks, which is the single most important rate to concentrate on, and 1.60 dlrs, Lawson said. His disclosure of two of the key targets for sterling was highly unusual, foreign exchange market analysts said. In the past he has preferred to be less definite about the Government's exchange rate policy, lest it give foreign exchange markets set limits to test. Lawson told the committee, which is a tripartite forum of government, unions and industry, that the pound would be kept near its present level by a mixture of interest rates and intervention in the foreign exchange markets. The pound finished trading here today at 1.6040/50 dlrs and 2.9210/45 marks. His disclosure of two of the key targets for sterling was highly unusual, foreign exchange market analysts said.

currency intervention timing crucial - analysts,dlr money-fx,"The dollar's recent decline, despite massive central bank purchases, is a forceful reminder that official intervention in the foreign exchanges can work only if it is well-timed to coincide with shifts in market fundamentals or sentiment, dealers and analysts said. Central banks may succeed in slowing a trend, but, without accompanying policy changes, they stand little chance of reversing the direction of an ever-growing global market in which more than 200 billion dlrs is traded every day, the sources said. ""Timing and psychology are the key to successful intervention,"" said Jim O'Neill, a financial markets economist with Marine Midland Banks Inc. The importance of complementary changes in economic fundamentals was underlined yesterday when a change in interest rates boosted the dollar, instantly achieving what the central banks had tried in vain to do for a week through open market intervention. After Citibank raised its prime rate by a quarter-point to 7-3/4 pct, the first change in the rate since last August, the dollar started to advance and reached a high in Tokyo of 147.50 yen, up two yen from Tuesday's New York low. By contrast, monetary authorities spearheaded by the Bank of Japan are estimated to have bought as much as 10 billion dlrs in the last 10 days of March but could not prevent the dollar from skidding through 150 yen and plumbing a 40-year low Monday of 144.70 yen. Some experts worry the central banks have lost more than just a temporary battle to prop up the dollar. The market is wary of being caught wrong-footed by a central bank foray, but is no longer mesmerized. ""They've lost their credibility. The market feels it can take on the central banks and win,"" said Michael Snow, head of treasury operations at Union Bank of Switzerland in New York. The relative failure of recent intervention stands in sharp contrast to the success that central banks scored when they joined forces to drive the dollar down following the September 22, 1985, Plaza accord. Then, however, central banks had an easy time of it, because the markets and the Treasuries of the major industrial powers were agreed that the dollar needed to head lower to redress massive worldwide trade imbalances. Now, there is no such consensus. The market is saying that the dollar must fall further because the U.S. trade deficit is showing little sign of improvement, while Japan is resisting in a bid to protect its export industries. For its part, the United States is apparently content to let the dollar fall gradually further and is paying little more than lip service to the February Paris agreement of the Group of Five plus Canada to foster stability, dealers say. Specifically, they said the Fed's dollar-buying intervention has been half-hearted, designed more as a political gesture to Japan than to strike fear into the markets. ""It's been pro-forma intervention,"" said Francoise Soares-Kemp, chief corporate trader at Credit Lyonnais. Because of this discord and the market's momentum for a lower dollar, analysts said intervention looks doomed to fail. ""It's going to take a lot more than the central banks to hold the dollar (at these levels),"" said Snow, who predicts another 10 to 15 pct depreciation. ""There have to be structural changes that occur to make the market stop selling dollars,"" added ""Buying six billion dollars in three weeks is not going to do it."" Late last decade during the presidency of Jimmy Carter, when the dollar was last under heavy speculative attack, central banks sometimes intervened to the tune of six billion dlrs in a single day but still failed to stop the dollar falling to a record low of 1.70 marks, analysts said. Snow said purchases on that scale now are unlikely. ""I don't think anybody has the stomach for it, because they saw the futility of it in the seventies."" Indeed, because the market has grown in leaps and bound since then, intervention on an even greater scale would probably be needed to impress the market. Trading volume in London, New York and Tokyo alone last year averaged nearly 188 billion dlrs a day, according to a joint central bank study, about double the previous estimate made just two years earlier by the Group of Thirty private research group. There are signs that central banks, too, realize the futility of swimming against the tide. Bank of Japan sources told Reuters in Tokyo earlier this week that they believed the limits of currency market intervention are perhaps being reached and that other methods for bolstering the dollar, such as invoking currency swap agreements with other central banks, are being considered. ""In this era of financial liberalization, it's almost impossible to control the flow of capital in and out of Japan,"" one senior official in Tokyo said."
chirac says france resolved to support currency pact,money-fx dlr yen,"French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac said that on financial issues, the United States and France had ""very close"" views, and he said Treasury Secretary James Baker was determined to support the February 22 Paris agreement on stabilizing foreign exchange parities. ""I was very reassured by the determination of Mr. Baker to support this agreement,"" he said. He described the dollar's sharp fall against the yen at the start of the week as a ""passing incident"" and added, ""Everyone is resolved to support the Paris accord."" Questioned about his plan to help the world's poorest countries, Chirac said he did not envisage any large-scale debt write-offs. ""I don't think we can talk of write-offs - even the poorest countries have not asked for that,"" he said. Chirac said he wanted commercial banks to give third world countries better terms in rescheduling their debts, and for the International Monetary Fund to soften its conditions. ""One cannot pity the banks - they bear a lot of responsibility due to the encouragement they gave to these countries to take on debts. Now the banks are complaining but I do not weep for them."""
heavy rains damage argentine coarse grains crop,grain oilseed sunseed corn soybean sorghum,"Fresh, heavy rains caused further damage to the Argentine 1986/87 coarse grains crop in the week to yesterday, particularly in Buenos Aires province, trade sources said. They said the sunflower, maize, soybean and sorghum crops were damaged and yield estimates affected. New production forecasts were made for all these crops. The rains over the weekend and up to yesterday registered more than 200 mm on average in western Buenos Aires and worsened the flooding in various parts of the province. The weather bureau said the rains, which in Buenos Aires have surpassed 750 mm in the last 30 days, could continue. The northeast of the country was also hit by heavy rains. In Corrientes province the rains also passed an average of 200 mm in some parts, notably the Paso de los Libres area bordering on Uruguay. In Santa Fe and Entre Rios provinces they were over 100 mm in places, in Misiones and San Luis 90 mm and in Cordoba 80 mm. The rains were less intense in Chaco and Formosa. Harvesting in areas not actually under water could also be further delayed due to dampness in the earth, the sources said. The excessive humidity might also produce rotting of the crops, further dimishing the yield, the sources added. Sunflower harvesting before the weekend rains reached 26 to 30 pct of the area sown in Santa Fe, Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires provinces. The production forecast for 1986/87 sunflowerseed has been lowered to between 2.2 and 2.4 mln tonnes, against 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes the previous week, making it 41.5 to 46.3 pct lower than the record 4.1 mln tonnes produced last season. The area sown was two to 2.2 mln hectares, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct on the record 3.14 mln hectares in 1985/86. The maize harvest advanced to within 26 to 28 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires. It will begin in La Pampa within about 10 days, weather permitting. Maize yield this season is now estimated at 9.6 to 9.9 mln tonnes, against last week's 9.9 to 10.1 mln tonnes, down 21.4 to 22.6 pct on the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes at which private producers put 1985/86 production. The new forecast is 22.7 to 25 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes for last season's production. The grain sorghum harvest reached 17 to 19 pct of growers' targets, against 14 to 16 pct the previous week. The production forecast was reduced to between three and 3.3 mln tonnes, against 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes last week, 21.4 to 26.8 pct down on last season's 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes. The area sown with sorghum in 1986/87 was 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares, down 10.3 to 15.2 pct on the 1.45 mln in 1985/86. The forecast for soybean yield this season was the least changed in relation to last week. It was put at a record 7.5 to 7.7 mln tonnes, against the previous 7.5 to 7.8 mln tonnes. These figures are 4.2 to 5.5 pct higher than last season's record of 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes, according to private sources, and 5.6 to 8.5 pct up on the official 7.1 mln tonnes. The adjustment to the production forecast is due to the rains and overcast conditions which have greatly reduced the sunlight needed for this crop, sources said. Producers fear estimates may yet have to be adjusted down further. The humidity could induce rotting and growers are still finding more empty pods due to excessively dry weather earlier in the season. Soybean harvesting is due to start in mid-April in southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires."

""Cumulative costs for the six-year period, 1984 to 1989, could approach 2.3 billion dlrs,"" he said. Between 1984 and 1986, reorganizations added almost 9,000 new persons to U.S. Agriculture Department payment rolls, Crowley told the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Wheat, Soybeans and Feedgrains."

analysts say ussr may prefer new crop u.s. wheat,grain wheat,"The Soviet Union would likely be more interested in purchasing new crop wheat than in booking any grain for immediate shipment if offered a subsidy on U.S. wheat, an executive with a major grain export company said. Lower prices and the desire to delay any big purchases until the condition of winter and spring crops is better known make new crop wheat more attractive, said George Hoffman, director of commodity analysis for The Pillsbury Company. ""Pillsbury is assuming that they (Soviets) will be offered a subsidy and that it will be a subsidy that they can respond to,"" Hoffman told Reuters in an interview at an agribusiness education conference here. But if there are too many constraints placed on a subsidy offer, the USSR will take less than an anticipated four mln tonnes, he said. Hoffman said Pillsbury's internal statistics put Soviet Union wheat purchases at only two mln tonnes under a subsidy offer. However, if a subsidy is offered at competitive levels, Moscow would likely buy more, he said. ""If we give the Soviets the same deal as the Chinese, I expect they'll take it,"" said Vernon McMinimy, director of commodity research for A.E. Staley Manufacturing Co. McMinimy told Reuters spring weather and its impact on crops will determine how much wheat Moscow would buy under a subsidy offer. Soviet winter crops did not get off to a good start because of a dry autumn last year, and because of the severe winter ""they probably have had more damage due to winter weather than normal,"" McMinimy said."

strong demand for u.s. corn in japan -- usda,corn grain,"Japan appears to be relying less on corn from China, Argentina and South Africa and more on supplies from the United States, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. In its World Production and Trade report, the department said in the past seven weeks reported U.S. corn sales of nearly three mln tonnes to Japan are about three times the level during this period last year. Reports of short Argentine supplies and the apparent unwillingness of the Chinese to sell at current world prices may have caused Japanese buyers to turn to the United States for corn supplies, the department said."
french subsidized corn for tunisia/morocco-usda,corn grain,"U.S. corn sales to Tunisia, Morocco and other North African countries may face increased competition from European Community (EC) corn sales, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. In its World Production and Trade report, the USDA said sales of French corn for nearby delivery have been confirmed with an export subsidy of about 145 dlrs per tonne, bringing the French price to about 72 dlrs per tonne, FOB. While this is about the same price as U.S. corn, EC corn has lower transport costs, the department noted. The French sales mark the beginning of commercial EC corn exports which could reach 750,000 tonnes to North Africa and the Middle East, areas which have traditionally purchased their corn needs from the United States, the department said. Department officials said the 750,000 tonnes of exports are for the year up to September 30 1987. They said export licenses for about 500,000 tonnes have been issued so far."

further declines in u.s. debt futures possible,interest dlr,"After an already steep fall in the past week, U.S. interest rate futures may be in for further declines in the near term, financial analysts said. However, some analysts said recent sharp losses in bond futures have left the bond market somewhat oversold, and the contracts on long-term debt could stage a recovery before resuming their decline. Key to the near-term direction of futures will be the course of the dollar, they said. ""As the dollar goes, so goes the bond market,"" said Dean Witter analyst Karen Gibbs. The recent decline in the dollar, which hit a 40-year low against the Japanese yen Monday, was reversed Wednesday when several large U.S. money center banks unexpectedly raised their prime lending rates by a quarter point, to 7-3/4 pct. ""Even though the prime rate cut was good for the dollar, foreign exchange traders are not convinced the dollar decline is over,"" Gibbs said. The dollar decline was key in recent weakness in debt futures as it rekindled concern about a pickup in inflation. Indeed, the falling dollar may have been a key topic at the meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, this week, analysts said. ""To the Fed, the combination of a falling dollar, a steepening yield curve, and rising commodity prices look suspiciously like the traces of expectations of accelerating inflation,"" said Denis Karnosky, analyst at Carroll, McEntee and McGinley Inc. Such expectations could mean that ""a shift in policy toward restriction of bank reserves is likely to get very serious consideration,"" at the FOMC meeting, he said. Any such restriction of reserves will not be a highly visible form of monetary tightening, Karnosky said. Rather, the key to detecting a change will be found in seasonal and adjustment borrowing at the discount window, he said. Borrowings have held near a weekly average of 300 mln dlrs over the past several months, he said. In the meantime, however, ""the market looks a bit oversold,"" said Jim Wysoglad, analyst at Golden Gate Futures. Wysoglad said a recovery from the oversold condition could drive June bonds to a high near 99 before falling back to test chart support near the recent low of 97-13/32. Technician Leslie Keefe of Technical Data Corp of Boston said that the key test for June bonds will be whether the nearby contract holds above chart support at 96-24/32. ""All previous selloffs since mid-November have stopped and buyers have surfaced at that level,"" Keefe said. If that level is broken, and the dollar continues to decline, Keefe said she expects the June bond contract to decline to test support between 92 and 93, the primary uptrend line dating back to 1984."

"u.s. house panel extends eep, urges ussr offer",grain wheat corn sugar carcass livestock groundnut oilseed cotton veg-oil,"The U.S. House Agriculture Committee approved proposals to extend the life of the Export Enhancement Program, EEP, through fiscal 1990 and urged the Reagan administration offer EEP wheat to the Soviet Union. The proposals were approved as amendments to a comprehensive trade bill moving through Congress this year. In addition to the amendments on EEP, the committee approved several proposals which could restrict imports of lamb, casein, sugar-containing products and tobacco. Those amendments affecting imports face an uncertain future because the House Ways and Means Committee, which has overall jurisdiction over trade legislation, will oppose them, Congressional sources said. The effect of the EEP amendments would be to extend the life of the program five years through fiscal 1990 rather than the current three years through fiscal 1988. The amendments, offered by Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., also would increase funding for the program to 2.5 billion dlrs from 1.5 billion now. Furthermore, the committee passed an amendment offered by Rep. Glickman which instructs the U.S. Agriculture Department to value EEP bonus commodities at market value, not acquisition value. Glickman said the change would make the program 30 pct less expensive to operate. The provision on EEP wheat to the Soviet Union, offered by Rep. Bob Smith, R-Ore., does not require the administration make an offer, but urges such action. The committee approved an amendment, offered by Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., requiring the Secretary of Agriculture to begin discussions with other major grain producing countries aimed at jointly reducing world grain production. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter yesterday opposed the amendment, saying such commodity agreements do not work. Among the host of amendments to restrict imports approved by the panel, the most significant would require quotas on imports of goods containing more than 25 pct of a bulk farm product that is subject to U.S. quotas. The amendment, offered by Rep. Arlan Stangeland, R-Minn., is aimed primarily at curbing imports from Canada of products containing sugar and foreign foods containing dairy products. It also may affect peanut, cotton and tobacco imports, Committee sources said. Another amendment would place a quota on U.S. imports of casein, a dairy product shipped to the U.S. primarily by New Zealand and Ireland. The panel also voted to apply to lamb imports the same countercyclical import quota law which is operating for U.S. beef imports. Other miscellaneous amendments included: -- Urging the administration consider retaliating against Japan and South Korea if those countries do not remove restrictions on beef imports. -- Boosting the amount of U.S. grain which must be shipped each year under a food aid program called Section 416 to 800,000 tonnes from 500,000 tonnes now. -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary conduct a study of the Canadian Wheat Board import licensing system for wheat to determine if it is a non-tariff trade barrier. -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary reimburse the National Corn Growers Association up to 500,000 dlrs for the costs of defending the U.S. feedgrains program against a Canadian countervailing duty case this year. -- Urging the administration oppose the Canadian decision to apply a duty on U.S. corn imports, and a proposal by the European Community to apply a vegetable oils tax. -- USDA conduct a study of the findings of a National Commission on Agricultural Export Policy, which recommended a reorganization of USDA's trade policy apparatus."

The department said no domestic poultry are involved in the outbreak. State quarantines have been placed on the two facilities, in Hunt Valley, Maryland, and Schenectady, New York. The most serious U.S. outbreak of the disease occurred in 1971-73 in southern California, where the disease spread from infected pet birds to a dense poultry population and nearly 12 mln birds, mostly laying hens, were destroyed at a cost of 56 mln dlrs, the department said."
world recession unlikely - deutsche's herrhausen,money-fx interest dlr,"A world recession is unlikely this year as fiscal and monetary policy in most industrialized countries is supporting the economy, Deutsche Bank AG <DBKG.F> management board joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen said. But growth rates will be smaller than last year, with 1.5 to 2.5 pct likely in most industrialized countries, he told a news conference. Herrhausen said he was confident private consumption would support economic growth in West Germany this year, with net income increases turning into purchasing power as long as inflation did not revive. Herrhausen said he did not expect interest rates to rise in West Germany this year, but there was little room for further falls. Rates in the U.S. were however rising, as evidenced by the latest prime rate moves, but this rise would be moderate. Herrhausen said he did not expect any major narrowing of the U.S. Trade and budget deficits in the next few months. One success of the Paris agreement in February to foster currency stability was that U.S. Officials have stopped talking down the dollar, he noted. The recent stability would last until markets decided to test the resolve of central banks, he said. He noted that central banks had spent some 10 billion dlrs this week to stabilize the dollar against the yen in the first such test. ""A massive attack on the mark, which could come if we get bad news out of the U.S., Would require a much higher intervention amount, raising the danger of inflation,"" he said. Turning to the international debt problem, Herrhausen said Brazil's unilateral debt moratorium had surprised banks. But the move showed that a real solution to debt problems was only possible with the involvement of all parties."
japan denies plans to cut duties on chocolate,trade cocoa,"Agriculture Ministry officials said they are not considering cuts in import duties on chocolate to help ease friction with the United States over agricultural trade. Japan has already lowered the duties sharply and we must consider domestic market conditions, an official said. Duties on chocolate were cut to 20 pct from 31.9 pct in April 1983. Washington has been demanding a cut to seven pct, equivalent to its own duties, ministry sources said. Japanese chocolate imports rose to 8,285 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 5,908 in 1985, official statistics show. However, the ministry sources added it is possible the government may make further cuts in response to strong U.S. And European demand. ""Due to concern about the farm trade row with the U.S., Top-level government officials may press the ministry to cut the duties,"" one said. But he said it would be difficult for Japan to resolve its overall trade row with Washington and reduce its trade surplus, which reached 58.6 billion dlrs in 1986. Agricultural trade issues between Japan and the U.S. Include Japanese import restrictions on 12 farm products."

Dealers said the market was surprised by the Chancellor's disclosure of sterling target rates, around 2.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs, and nervous over the implications for domestic interest rates, further reducing the propects for a near term cut in U.K. Bank base rates. The key three months interbank sterling rate gained 1/16 point at 10 9-7/8 pct. The pound opened three basis points lower at 71.3 in trade weighted terms, at around 1.59 dlrs and 2.91 marks."

Some thought a rate cut unlikely given foreign exchange turbulence and the U.S. Prime rate rise to 7 3/4 pct, while others still counted on a 1/4 point cut by the Bank of France."
rising taiwan dollar causes foreign reserves loss,money-fx reserves,"Taiwan said its foreign reserves suffered about 3.4 billion U.S. Dlrs in exchange rate losses from July 1986 to February 1987 as a result of the rise of the Taiwan dollar against the U.S. Currency. Yu Chien-ming, head of the government statistics department, told parliament yesterday he expected the losses to increase as the Taiwan dollar continues to strengthen. The Taiwan dollar, which opened at 34.24 to the U.S. Dollar today, has risen about 16 pct against the U.S. Unit since September 1985. Some bankers expect it to rise to 33 by June and to 32 by the end of this year. Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves now total 53 billion dlrs. At end-February they were 52.1 billion dlrs, the world's third largest after West Germany and Japan. Yu said the interest earned from the reserves totalled about 1.68 billion U.S. Dlrs from July 1986 to February 1987. The reserves are managed by the central bank and deposited at about 170 leading banks in the U.S., Japan, Britain, Canada and Singapore. About 75 pct of the reserves are in the form of cash, mostly in U.S. Dollars. The rest are in government treasury bills, certificates of deposit and bonds."

She denied that any unpublished clause of the agreement guaranteed the bulk of the maize export business would go to the U.S., As one EC official told Reuters yesterday. Under the agreement, the EC will import two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum a year into Spain at specially reduced levy rates for the next four years. The Commission has yet to decide whether the maize will come in through direct purchases by the Spanish intervention board or by a tender system."
u.k. money rates firm on lawson sterling targets,money-fx interest stg,"Interest rates on the London money market were slightly firmer on news U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson had stated target rates for sterling against the dollar and mark, dealers said. They said this had come as a surprise and expected the targets, 2.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs, to be promptly tested in the foreign exchange markets. Sterling opened 0.3 points lower in trade weighted terms at 71.3. Dealers noted the chancellor said he would achieve his goals on sterling by a combination of intervention in currency markets and interest rates. Operators feel the foreign exchanges are likely to test sterling on the downside and that this seems to make a fall in U.K. Base lending rates even less likely in the near term, dealers said. The feeling remains in the market, however, that fundamental factors have not really changed and that a rise in U.K. Interest rates is not very likely. The market is expected to continue at around these levels, reflecting the current 10 pct base rate level, for some time. The key three months interbank rate was 1/16 point firmer at 10 9-7"
awb calls for tighter wheat quality controls,grain wheat,"Australia is risking wheat export sales by not providing enough specific quality grades to meet buyer requirements, the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) said. ""Many AWB customers are becoming increasingly quality conscious, demanding strict adherence to contractual quality specifications,"" the board said in a submission to the Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport. ""Many of the specifications are more specific than the current categories used in Australia,"" it said. The commission is trying to identify ways of saving costs and boosting efficiency of the grain handling system. Australia must rely on quality to retain its wheat market share because its competitors are supplying cheaper but lower-quality grades, the AWB submission said. It stressed the need to segregate wheat categories at every stage from receival to shipping. Better industrial relations at grain terminals, more uniform transport systems across the states and extensive stock control were vital to improved marketing, it said. The submission also said Australia's federal system impeded the AWB's role of coordinating and managing the marketing of wheat. The AWB called for an end to physical and legislative constraints at state borders that prevent the efficient transport of grains to other states for shipment. ""It is essential that wheat moves by the most economic mode to the nearest efficient port, irrespective of the state in which the wheat is grown or stored,"" it said. For example, wheat grown in northern New South Wales (NSW) might move more efficiently to Brisbane, in Queensland, than to Sydney or Newcastle in New South Wales, it said. Similarly, southern NSW wheat might better be shipped to Portland or Geelong, in Victoria. Legislation giving state rail authorities a monopoly over grain shipments was one notable impediment, it said. The AWB said the current approach of state-based bulk handling authorities is not essential, although it said it favoured the authorities maintaining at least their current level of control of storage and transport as long as quality was maintained. An appendix on port loading costs showed it cost between 26,500 and 34,700 U.S. Dlrs to load a 50,000-tonne vessel at various Australian ports compared with 21,200 dlrs at Houston and 16,300 at Port Cartier, Quebec, for a 60,000-tonner."
japan ministry asks trust banks to cut dlr sales,money-fx dlr,"The Finance Ministry has asked trust banks to moderate their dollar selling, trust banking sources said. A Ministry official told Reuters earlier this week the Ministry had recently surveyed foreign exchange transactions by institutional investors, but he declined to say whether this was aimed at moderating the dollar sales. Dealers said institutional investors were reluctant to sell dollars aggressively today partly because of the Ministry monitoring. One senior trust bank source said that while sympathizing with the Ministry position, the trust banks had to conduct their foreign exchange operations according to the dictates of the market. A Bank of Japan official said the central bank approved of the survey as long it was not used too forcefully. But another official denied local press reports that the central bank itself had asked investors to moderate their dollar sales. ""We are not legally authorized to do that,"" he said. A Bank of Japan official also said the central bank will renew its call on financial institutions to moderate excessive loans for the purpose of land and securities investment as such investments threaten to cause inflation. Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita had previously expressed concern about excessive investment in land and securities resulting partly from eased credit conditions."

india's credit policy aims to control liquidity,money-supply wpi,"India's credit policy package for fiscal 1987/88 (April-March) will help ease inflationary pressures and control the growth of overall liqudity, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said in a statement. The package, announced earlier this week, will raise commercial bank statutory liquidity ratios to 37.5 pct from 37 pct, effective April 25, and will increase cash reserve ratios on foreign currency (non-resident) accounts to 9.5 pct from three pct, effective May 23, it said. Excess liquidity pushed wholesale and consumer retail prices higher in 1986/87 on previous year levels, RBI governor R. N. Malhotra said in a statement. Malhotra said India's M-3 money supply grew 209.24 billion rupees in the fiscal year to March 13, compared to a growth of 155.38 billion in the same period the year before. Commercial bank aggregate deposits rose to 164.10 billion in the same period, against 120.66 billion in the corresponding months of fiscal 1986/87, he said. The Finance Ministry in a report issued in February predicted India's fiscal 1986/87 wholesale price-linked inflation rate at about 6.5 pct against 3.8 pct in 1985/86."

He told Parliament that in the southern provinces the harvest would be over 50 pct down on the level in the previous marketing year. ""The nation would be lucky to produce over seven mln bags (630,000 tonnes) of maize this year,"" he stated.

lawson remarks dash hopes of early u.k. rate cut,interest money-fx stg,"Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's remarks yesterday suggesting there are precise exchange rate targets for the pound undermined sterling, dashing hopes for an early cut in U.K. Base rates, analysts said. But the market's reaction, testing exchange rate levels indicated by Lawson, was probably overdone and the longer term outlook for sterling remained bullish, they agreed. In an apparent break with the previous policy of secrecy, Lawson told a National Economic Development Council meeting he was comfortable with sterling exchange rates around current levels, specifying rates of around 1.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs. Lawson added the U.K. Government intended to keep sterling at about present levels, using currency intervention and interest rates to achieve this. The February 22 Paris agreement of the Group of Five and Canada to stabilise exchange rates is widely believed to include target ranges, but all participants to the meeting had so far refused to specify these. Markets were quick to react to the statement, chopping about one U.S. Cent and over one pfennig off the pound to match the levels mentioned by Lawson. But most analysts polled said they did not believe Lawson's statement signalled a change in U.K. Policy. Keith Skeoch, chief economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co, said, ""the remarks have been blown out of proportion. Lawson is paying now for a little bit of a slip of the tongue."" Barclays de Zoete Wedd economist Mark Brett said, ""there is nothing great and fantastic in the Chancellor's statement."" He said he did not believe the rates indicated by the Chancellor were precise targets, but merely represented central rates around which sterling would be allowed to fluctuate, perhaps by as much as 10 pct. ""It would be insane to pinpoint an exchange rate ahead of an election ... I don't believe Lawson is mad enough to tie himself to a fixed rate,"" Brett said. Currency markets were keen for official statements to clarify the scope of the Paris accord and reactivate currency trading. This mood easily led to over-reaction, analysts said. ""Making similar statements when the market is high strung and ready to bounce is perhaps a mistake,"" one senior dealer with a U.S. Bank said. Capel's Skeoch said, ""it gives the foreign exchange markets something to shoot at."" ""It is obvious that the government, as a member of the Group of Six, has agreed exchange rate bands. But they are not cut in stone, they can change with time,"" Skeoch said. Brett said, ""we think the 2.90 marks level is a central rate. Give or take 10 pfennigs and all is fine."" Not all analysts played down the significance of the remarks, however. Chris Dunn, economist at Royal Bank of Canada, said the remarks may signal a decisive move to insulate sterling from the fortunes of the dollar. Although about two-thirds of Britain's trade is conducted with European countries, sterling has traditionally shadowed the dollar rather than the mark, analysts noted. ""Britain must decide whether it wants to follow the U.S. Or throw in its lot with Europe,"" Dunn said. ""It suggests that while the U.K. Is not actually applying to join the European Monetary System, it is seeking protection by shadowing it ... The Bundesbank has made it clear that it wants the U.K. To clarify its position relative to the mark,"" he said. Analysts said sterling's dip on currency markets following Lawson's remarks made an early half-point cut in U.K. Base rates from current 10 pct levels unlikely in the short term. ""Over the next three weeks, a cut is out, unless we get some extremely good economic indicators,"" Capel's Skeoch said. Base rates have been cut twice by one-half point in March, the last after the March 17 budget presentation, and analysts had been expecting another half point cut shortly afterwards."

The bank's target range for growth in this measure in 1987 is 6.5 to 9.5 pct, compared with 11.4 pct last year. Rubio said he was aiming for the lower end of the range. He added that real GDP growth of three pct in 1986 was due to a six pct increase in real internal demand and a three pct real drop in the contribution of the external sector. The aim for 1987 was for the same real growth in GDP but a drop in the internal contribution to 4.5 pct with the negative component of the external sector trimmed to 1.5 pct, he said."

lawson says sterling target comments insignificant,stg money-fx,"Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson criticised media coverage of comments he made yesterday, when he was reported as saying he wanted sterling to stay roughly where it was, specifying a rate of around 2.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs to the pound.

lyng sets tough u.s. stance with japan on beef,livestock carcass trade,"U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng warned Japan that the failure to remove a longstanding import quota on Japanese beef might spark a protectionist response in the United States. ""Given the protectionist mood in the Congress and the country, if I were a leader in Japan I would certainly be very concerned...and the failure to remove it (the beef quota) might be very serious,"" Lyng told a group of U.S cattlemen. Lyng said he and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, during a visit to Japan later this month, will demand ""total elimination"" of the beef import quota by April 1988. The current dispute with Japan over semiconductor may strengthen the U.S. stance in farm trade negotiations, Lyng said, because Japan does not want a trade war with the U.S. Lyng dismissed recent statements in Tokyo that Japan might retaliate against U.S. products as a result of the semiconductor dispute. ""They (Japan) aren't going to pick a fight with us,"" Lyng said, adding that with its huge bilateral trade surplus Japan has more to lose in a trade war than the United States. Lyng told the U.S. cattlemen that the quota on Japanese beef imports does not allow consumers there an adequate choice in food purchases. He said in addition to beef, the U.S. will press for eliminiation of import barriers on Japan's citrus and rice as well. Lyng noted that Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. farm products, principally grains and soybeans."

Speaking to representatives of the U.S. National Cattlemen's Association, NCA, Lyng attacked what he called recent ""terribly biased"" press reports critical of USDA poultry inspection. He cited a report on CBS ""60 Minutes"" which criticized USDA salmonella detection in poultry. ""I know we have the finest meat and poultry inspection system in the world,"" Lyng told the cattlemen.

Earlier, Paris trade sources said the EC Commission made available a further 70,000 tonnes of British intervention feed wheat for sale to the domestic market."
eyskens says us prime rises will aid currencies,interest money-fx,"Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens warmly welcomed this week's increase in U.S. Prime rates, calling it a move that went beyond the Group of Five and Canada Paris accord on stabilising currencies. The rate rise would underpin economic and financial policy convergence among major countries, he added. In an interview with Reuters, Eyskens also made clear he believed the countries involved in the accord - the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and Canada - had agreed ""tentative"" fluctuation ranges for exchange rates. Eyskens was speaking before hosting an informal meeting of European Community finance ministers and central bank chiefs in Belgium this weekend focusing on the international monetary situation and proposals for strengthening the European Monetary System (EMS). Asked about the dollar's recent fall on currency markets, Eyskens said he believed the Paris agreement was proving ""more or less workable"" despite what he called evident disagreements over U.S. Economic and monetary policy between Treasury Secretary James Baker and Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. Besides Baker's public statements that had dramatically influenced exchange markets, trade tensions between the U.S.And Japan had also caused the dollar's fall, expecially against the yen, he said. But he expressed optimism that Washington and Tokyo could reach a compromise in their row over semi-conductor trade. ""I think agreement is quite possible,"" he said. Eyskens said he was ""very agreeably surprised"" by this week's quarter-point increase in U.S. Prime rates despite the obvious negative consequences for debtor countries. ""It is a positive element which goes further than the (Paris) Louvre agreement ...It is the market taking account of its content,"" he said. He added that coordination of interest rates was a fundamental element of economic and monetary convergence between leading industrialised economies. ""A policy of maintaining exchange rates within fluctuation ranges is not possible if it is not accompanied at least by a more coordinated policy of interest rates,"" he said. Eyskens made clear he believed the G-6 countries had agreed in Paris on ranges in which to hold their currencies. He said the end of the February 22 Louvre accord, in which the partners agreed to cooperate closely to foster exchange rate stability around current levels, clearly alluded to a ""system of tentative (fluctuation) margins."" He added the meeting and the statement would have been meaningless if the G-6 had not discussed the technicalities of implementing it. Eyskens said there was growing economic convergence among leading industrialised countries pointing towards greater order in the international monetary system. ""That doesn't mean we are ready to restore Bretton Woods (the post-World War Two system of fixed exchange rates), but within the (International Monetary Fund) Interim Committee we are thinking in terms of target zones, fluctuation ranges to be implemented and defended,"" he said. The Interim Committee meets next week in Washington ahead of the IMF's Spring meetings, and Eyskens said the EC ministers would prepare for the gatherings at this weekend's talks. He said he hoped for wide-ranging talks on the future of the EMS at the weekend meeting, based on proposals from the EC's Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors for strengthening the system through technical and institutional changes. Eyskens said he expected EC Commission President Jacques Delors to submit proposals for fully liberalising capital movements within the 12-nation bloc and made clear he shared Delors' view that this must be accompanied by a reinforcement of the EMS. ""Both are totally linked. Liberalisation without strengthening the EMS would destabilise the Community,"" he said."

"sterling rebounds on lawson ""target""-denial",stg money-fx,"Sterling made a sharp recovery when U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson described remarks he made yesterday on targets for the pound as ""insignificant,"" rallying back up almost exactly to the levels it had fetched before Lawson spoke yesterday, dealers and analysts said. They said sterling would likely leave the limelight once again to trade quietly around current levels, as the markets set their sights on the dollar, yen and mark again ahead of key international monetary talks in Washington next week. Sterling ended its European day at 1.6020/30 dlrs, virtually unchanged from yesterday's last 1.6040/50 dlrs, fetched before Lawson's first comment. But it was well up on levels just above 1.59 dlrs which it had held until the second comment came. Against the mark, sterling recovered to close at 2.9190/9240 marks after today's opening 2.9040/90 and last night's 2.9210/45. ""On balance, it is as if nothing happened ... We are back to where we were before,"" Mark Brett, economist at securities house Barclays de Zoete Wedd said. ""This whole story is like a storm in a teacup,"" a dealer with a U.K. Bank commented. The pound's recovery was triggered when Lawson criticised media coverage of comments he made yesterday, when he told a conference he wanted sterling to stay roughly where it was. In this context, Lawson was reported to have specified rates of around 2.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs to the pound in remarks which markets were quick to interpret as a signal to sell sterling. Lawson said today he had merely stated yesterday's approximate value of the pound. ""The wrong end of the stick was picked up,"" he told reporters, adding his comments did in no way signal a change in British exchange rate policies. Dealers and analysts said the reactions to both statements were clear evidence that the market, frustrated by the relative currency stability after the February 22 Paris agreement, was desperate to reactivate trading and would react to any clues offered about the contents of the currency accord. In Paris, finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada are widely believed to have agreed exchange rate targets, although no participant has specified these in an apparent bid to foster stability by keeping markets guessing. ""The markets are absolutely desperate to get clues on Group of Six (countries that are part to the Paris agreement) targets ... The number of rumours flying around is bigger than ever before,"" said Barclays de Zoete Wedd's Brett. Analysts said neither yesterday's remarks nor today's had changed their impression that after Paris, sterling was targeted to trade in broad ranges against major currencies. All polled analysts said if anything, the 2.90 marks level mentioned by Lawson was probably the centre of a wide 20-pfennig range which sterling would easily hold, helped by good economic indicators and relatively high interest rates. ""It would be insane to pinpoint an exchange rate ahead of an election ... I don't believe Lawson is mad enough to tie himself to a fixed rate,"" Brett said. He expected sterling to firm over the next few weeks, to around 2.95 marks and 1.63 dlrs, as overseas investors reappraised high-yielding investments here. Robin Marshall, chief economist at Chase Manhattan Securities, said he was not surprised to see Lawson qualify his sterling target comments so quickly. ""His remarks gave markets a target to aim at,"" he said, adding, ""He (Lawson) talked himself into a bit of a corner on this ... It made him a hostage to fortune."" Marshall and other analysts dismissed a theory, that by quoting target rates Lawson had attempted to put pressure on prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to agree to British membership of the European Monetary System (EMS), as implausible."

Total corn commitments for delivery in the fourth year of the U.S.-USSR Grain Supply Agreement amount to 2,650,000 tonnes."
u.s. acreage cuts seen limiting stock build,grain wheat corn oilseed soybean,"Sharp cuts this year in U.S. planted acreage may not make a big dent in the U.S. grain stockpile but will at least keep grain surpluses from increasing, Agriculture Department and industry commodity analysts said. ""The scenario is turning around on stocks. The whole supply/demand picture could finally be getting more in balance,"" a USDA analyst said. The USDA prospective plantings report this week indicated that U.S. farmers will idle 52 to 55 mln acres in annual acreage reduction programs this year. An additional 20 mln acres have been enrolled in the conservation reserve program, bringing total idled acreage in the U.S. to 72-75 mln acres, almost a third of the nation's total 235 mln acre crop base. Production of wheat, corn and soybeans in 1986/87 will probably closely match annual usage, limiting any buildup in stocks, analysts said. ""It's a substantially different story from last year when we added 1.5 billion bushels of corn to the stockpile,"" Vernon McMinimy, director of commodity research for Staley Co. said. Interviewed at an agribusiness education conference here, McMinimy said that 67.6 mln planted acres of corn will likely translate into 60 mln harvested acres, and with normal yields, final production of 6.9 to 7.0 billion bushels. McMinimy estimated that total U.S. corn disappearance in 1986/87 could end up at 7.1 billion bushels, possibly resulting in a 200-million bushel reduction in the current corn stockpile of 5.45 billion bushels. ""To say this represents a turn-around is wrong, but we're at least in a holding pattern,"" George Hoffman, director of commodity analysis for Pillsbury said. Hoffman said wheat stocks could rise slightly by the end of 1986/87 to 1.9 billion bushels due to ""significantly less"" domestic feed use for wheat because of lower corn prices. USDA analysts, however, project slightly higher usage and said wheat stocks will either decrease slightly or at least not increase. With yearly use at around two billion bushels, next year's projected crop could be used up, an analyst said. ""We won't be adding to stocks. Stocks are at a record now, so if we can begin to touch them even minutely through acreage reductions, that would be an improvement,"" an Agriculture Department wheat analyst said. Soybean planted acreage, at 56.9 mln acres, would be the smallest planted soybean acreage since 1976 and could lower final production by 150 mln bushels and ending stocks by 50 to 100 mln bushels, analysts said. As more marginal, erodable acreage is enrolled in the conservation reserve program, annual acreage reduction programs will be more effective because they will force more high producing land out of production, a USDA analyst said. ""We can now maybe see the light at the end of a very long tunnel,"" the analyst said."

Total shipments in the third year of the U.S.-USSR grains agreement, which ended September 30, amounted to 152,600 tonnes of wheat, 6,808,100 tonnes of corn and 1,518,700 tonnes of soybeans."

pik-and-roll pressures corn basis values,grain corn,"Changes by the USDA in its posted county prices have successfully increased PIK-and-roll activity as a way to pull corn out of government stockpiles, with the resulting jump in free supplies pressuring terminal corn basis values, cash grain dealers said. Processors dropped spot Chicago corn basis bids three cents after covering most of the April needs this week, with river corn basis bids following CIF Gulf corn values lower. The surge in PIK-and-roll also pressured corn futures, with May settling today down three cents per bushel at 1.58-1/2 dlrs, near the contract low of 1.49-1/4 dlrs. But unlike in the past when lower prices slowed country movement, now lower county prices widen the differentials with the corn loan and make PIK-and-roll even more attractive, they noted."

South Korean demand for imported ethylene this month has risen to 17,000 tonnes from 10,000 last month, and the country may face difficulties covering the extra volume, they said. <Korea Petrochemical Industries Corp>, a producer of high density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene, will more than double its ethylene requirements to 9,000 tonnes a month from 4,000 when it completes a plant expansion at the end of this month, the sources said. <Honan Ethylene Corp's> import requirements have risen to 8,000 tonnes a month from 6,000 tonnes last year to meet strong demand from <Honan Petrochemical Co>, which makes HDPE and ethylene glycol, and <Hangyang Chemical>, which produces low-density polyethylene and vinyl chloride monomer, they said. But Japan's ethylene plants are already operating at almost full capacity of 4.5 mln tonnes a year just to fulfill domestic demand, the sources said. ""And even if Japan had the additional ethylene, there is a logistical problem of finding extra appropriate-sized vessels to ship it to Korea,"" said one trading house source. Japanese trading companies are looking to alternative sources to supply South Korea's needs, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Mexico, they said. But long-haul voyages are expensive as the product has to be shipped at a temperature of minus 103 degrees centigrade to keep it in a liquid form, they said. Japan has no plans to invest further in the ethylene industry in order to cope with the additional demand, despite rising prices, trading house sources said. South Korea has two projects in hand which will increase its ethylene production capacity by 500,000 tonnes a year by the end of 1989, so the strong demand surge for imports is only a medium-term trend, they said."
swiss 1988 inflation seen at two pct - institute,cpi gnp ipi,"Swiss inflation is likely to rise in 1987 and 1988 because of inflationary tendencies in the domestic economy, the Centre for Economic Research of the Federal Institute of Technology said in its spring review. It forecast a rise in consumer prices of two pct in 1988 compared with 1.3 pct in 1987. Low import prices in 1986 helped to keep annual inflation down to 0.8 pct. The centre said that in general the outlook for the Swiss economy in 1987 and 1988 remained favourable, despite the more difficult international economic climate facing export industry. The centre repeated its previous forecast that growth in Swiss domestic product would slow to 2.2 pct in 1987 from 2.5 pct in 1986. It revised its forecast for 1988 GDP growth to 1.7 pct from 1.6 pct in its last autumn review. Domestic demand will continue to replace exports as the motor of economic growth. Private consumption will grow by three pct in 1987 and two pct in 1988 against 3.75 pct in 1986. Growth in goods exports will slow to 1.75 pct in 1987 from 2.1 pct in 1986 but pick up slightly to 2.5 pct in 1988. All three figures are well below the Swiss average for recent years. In 1985, for example, exports increased by 9.1 pct. The centre said the strength of the Swiss franc, which has firmed sharply in recent months, would continue to put pressure on Swiss exporters. It forecast that imports of goods would grow by a more modest 4.5 pct in 1987 and 3.25 pct in 1988 than in 1986, when import prices fell substantially and imports rose by 8.2 pct. Industrial production will grow by 1.6 pct in 1987 and 1.2 pct in 1988 compared with 4.2 pct in 1986."
"no intervention, dollar fixed at 1.8162 marks",dlr money-fx,"The Bundesbank did not intervene as the dollar was fixed lower at 1.8162 marks after 1.8270 yesterday, dealers said. The dollar firmed slightly from its opening 1.8135/45 marks in very quiet pre-weekend trading and dealers said they expected business to remain thin this afternoon. ""Trading is at an absolute nil, nobody wants to get involved ahead of next week's meetings,"" one dealer with a U.S. Bank said, referring to the Group of Seven industrial nations and the International Monetary Fund meetings in Washington. Dealers saw the dollar staying at current levels but possibly rising above 1.83 marks on any supporting remarks emerging from the meetings. ""But the dollar's medium-term direction is soft,"" one dealer said. The dollar could well come under renewed pressure after the international forums as attention returned to the U.S. And the U.K.'s trade dispute with Japan, dealers said. Cross currency trading was also subdued though sterling's rise above 1.60 dlrs helped it to firm against the mark. It was fixed higher at 2.924 marks after yesterday's 2.910. The pound was seen staying between 2.90 and 2.93 marks for the next days, dealers said. Eurodollar deposit rates were steady from this morning, with six month funds unchanged at midpoint 6-11/16 pct. Six month euromarks stayed at midpoint 3-7/8 pct. The Swiss franc firmed to 119.86 marks per 100 at the fix from 119.71 yesterday and the yen rose to 1.244 marks per 100 from 1.243.

london freight market features ussr timecharters,ship grain,"Active timecharter fixing by Soviet operators to cover USSR grain imports featured the freight market, ship brokers said. At least two fixtures were reported on Soviet account to lift EC grain, with a 22,000 tonner booked from Tilbury for a voyage via lower Baltic Sea and redelivery passing Skaw at 4,000 dlrs daily and a 27,000 tonner from Ceuta for a voyage via the U.K. And redelivery Skaw-Cape Passero at 4,500 dlrs daily. The Soviets also secured a 34,000 tonner from Gibraltar for a trans-Atlantic round trip at 4,500 dlrs daily and a 61,000 tonner for similar business at 6,750 dlrs daily. Brokers said several other fixtures were also thought to be connected with Soviet grain, including a 69,000 tonner from Taranto for five to seven months at 6,500 dlrs daily. Similar fixing was reported yesterday at 6,000 dlrs. Other timecharter fixing included a 14,000 tonner from Indonesia to the U.S. Gulf at 2,800 dlrs daily and a combined carrier of 75,000 tonnes dw from the U.S. Gulf to Italy at 9,000 dlrs daily. Severel vessels were booked from Antwerp-Hamburg range, including a 61,000 tonner bound for Singapore-Japan at 7,500 dlrs daily and a 16,000 tonner destined for west coast India at 5,000 dlrs. Grain fixing was much quieter out of the U.S. Gulf, with no fresh business seen on the significant routes to the Continent or Japan, although tonnage was secured for at least five small corn cargoes from the Gulf to Jamaica at between 21 and 25 dlrs. Wheat from the River Plate and Buenos Aires to Sri Lanka received 26 dlrs. Market talk suggested 11 dlrs had been paid for grain from the U.S. North Pacific to Japan but no confirmation was available. Fairly active grain fixing emerged out of the Continent, however, with maize covered from Nantes to Egypt at 15 dlrs, and bagged flour from Greece to China at 27 dlrs. Barley cargoes were arranged from Immingham to the Red Sea at 17.25 dlrs and from Foynes to Jeddah at 17.25 dlrs."

The corn will be shipped in the coming days from Valencia. He said CINDASA will also ship 6,000 to 7,000 tonnes of Spanish corn to Italy in the second half of this month. The CINDASA spokesman said other corn shipments this month will include between 15,000 and 30,000 tonnes bound initially for Rotterdam and Ghent and destined for unspecified northern European countries. He said shipments of 35,000 to 50,000 tonnes of low specific gravity barley were also expected this month and added that Greece, the Netherlands, Ireland and Belgium were considering imports of Spanish flour for milling. Market sources said the corn exports, the absence of imports from the rest of the EC and the delay in shipments of corn from the U.S. Had pushed domestic corn prices up by around 0.25 pesetas a kilo today compared with yesterday."

pakistan not seen as major wheat exporter,wheat grain,"Pakistan is not emerging as a major wheat exporter as world market prospects are not good enough, Sartaj Aziz, Special Assistant on Food and Agriculture to the Pakistani Prime Minister, said in an interview. No exports are planned for the next 12 months or so and plans last year to sell one mln tonnes to Iran came to nothing because they could not agree a price, he said. Aziz forecast that Pakistan may have exportable surpluses of one mln tonnes or a half mln tonnes over the next few harvests in years when the weather is favourable. The government does not wish to increase output much above this because of low world prices, and the land would be better used for other crops. Aziz said the Pakistani government does not want area sown to wheat to increase from the current seven mln hectares. Some 10 pct of that area which gives low yields could be switched to more profitable crops such as oilseeds. The aim is to concentrate on raising yields from the current 1.8 to 1.9 tonnes per ha to at least 2.5 tonnes per ha over the next five to seven years, he said. Aziz said the current 1986/87 crop, harvesting of which is just beginning, is expected to yield around a record 14.5 mln tonnes. This compares with a target of 14.7 mln and last year's yield of 14.0 mln. He said rains some six weeks ago helped the crop but more recent rains reduced prospects slightly. The long-term wheat production target is for some 17 mln tonnes by mid-1993, taking into account Pakistan's annual population growth rate of more than three pct. Current consumption is some 12.5 mln tonnes. The current wheat reserve is 2.5 mln tonnes, Aziz said. This compares with a minimum reserve commitment of one mln tonnes, which Pakistan will maintain at all costs, and a ""strategic reserve"" target of two mln tonnes. Despite the fact that stocks are a half-mln tonnes over target, the surplus will not be exported at present, he said. The government wants to keep an extra ""safety margin"" until it sees what effect the abolition of a 44-year-old wheat rationing system will have on domestic consumption. New exports will be considered only in about a year's time when the 1987/88 crop can be gauged as well, he said. The new domestic policy, introduced on March 15, is for the government to supply unlimited quantities of wheat at two rupees per kilo. With other costs this means a price in Pakistani markets of between 2.30 and 2.50 rupees per kilo. Under the old system, introduced during World War Two and due to be phased out by April 15, some 50 mln ration cards were issued enabling poor people to buy wheat cheaply. Aziz said following the introduction of a government support price in the 1970s the system become so corrupted that only 20 to 25 pct of subsidised wheat was actually reaching the consumer, the rest being diverted illicitly to the mills. The ration system had also not had the stabilising effect on the internal wheat market that was intended, Aziz said. Prices have already begun to fall with the introduction of the new system. The wheat price in Karachi, the most expensive Pakistani city, had dropped from 3.11 rupees per kilo on March 1 to 2.85 rupees on March 30. Aziz said he does not expect the change in system to have a major effect on total consumption, but it may encourage better use of side-products such as bran."

usda corrects turkey credit announcement,plywood lumber,"The U.S. Agriculture Department said an announcement by the department yesterday concerning 15.0 mln dlrs in additional credit guarantees for exports of U.S. commodities to Turkey contained two inaccuracies. First, the USDA said its announcement should not have said that plywood was excluded from the additional three mln dlrs in GSM-102 credit guarantees for lumber. The original announcement said the guarantees included three mln dlrs for lumber, except plywood. Melvin Sims, USDA general sales manager, told Reuters he did not anticipate any plywood would be included in the sales, but that ""it's possible it would be."" Plywood in the past has not been eligible for GSM-102 credit guarantees because it is considered by some to be a manufactured product. Members states of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have pledged not to offer concessional credits on manufactured products, Sims said. However, the Reagan administration is considering whether to allow plywood sales to be covered by the credit guarantee program, Sims said. Second, the USDA announcement said 6.0 mln dlrs of a previously announced 6.0-mln dlr line for tallow under GSM-102 was available for both public and private sector importers. In fact, the line of credit guarantees for tallow is available only for public sector importers, Walter Stern, Foreign Agricultural Service Turkey analyst, said."
plywood credits eyed by reagan administration,plywood lumber,"The Reagan administration is debating whether to provide government credit guarantees for the export of plywood, a U.S. Agriculture Department official said. As a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, the United States has agreed not to provide any concessional credits on the export of manufactured products. However, USDA General Sales Manager Melvin Sims told Reuters the administration is considering allowing USDA to provide its first export credit guarantees for plywood on the grounds it is not a manufactured product. Sims said it was clear that wood products such as furniture, tables and window frames would be considered manufactured goods and therefore ineligible for export credit guarantees. However, the case of plywood was less clear. ""As long as it's a basic material, we consider it still just a processed version of the basic agricultural commodity,"" Sims said in a telephone interview. Earlier today, USDA said that plywood was eligible under an export credit guarantee offer for Turkey announced yesterday. In its original announcement yesterday, USDA had said the offer included three mln dlrs for the export of lumber, excluding plywood. However, Sims said he did not expect any plywood exports to be including under the lumber guarantee offer."
ec wheat release unlikely to satisfy u.k. demand,wheat grain,"The European Commission's decision to release an additional 300,000 tonnes of British intervention feed wheat for the home market will provide only moderate relief in an increasingly tight market, traders said. Some operators had been anticipating a larger tonnage, pointing out that at this week's U.K. Intervention tender the market sought to buy 340,000 tonnes but only 126,000 tonnes were granted. The new tranche of intervention grain is unlikely to satisfy demand, they said, and keen buying competition for supplies in stores is expected to keep prices firm. The release of the feed wheat followed recent strong representations by the U.K. Grain trade to the Commission. There has been growing concern that rising internal prices, triggered by heavy exports, were creating areas of shortage in interior markets. The latest EC authorisation will add 70,000 tonnes at the April 14 tender and a further 30,000 tonnes later in the month. The remaining 200,000 tonnes will be made available in May and June. News of the release produced an early downward reaction in local physical markets, but by midday some sections had halved early two stg losses while others were unchanged. Ministry of Agriculture figures for March indicate 1.85 mln tonnes of wheat and 1.74 mln tonnes of barley remain in the free market. However, some traders believe these figures are overstated and, while some may still be held on the farm, the bulk of wheat is already sold. Some of the grain is also off the market in futures stores. A total of 2.10 mln tonnes of intervention wheat has been sold for export or to the home market since the season started July 1, leaving an unsold balance in intervention of about 1.59 mln tonnes. Intervention barley sales have reached just over 1.0 mln tonnes, leaving about 753,000 tonnes, traders said. This season's U.K. Export performance has surpassed all early expectations and has created the present nervous situation in domestic markets where the fear now is free market supplies may not last out until new crop becomes available in August. The market is sticking to its recent prediction of total barley and wheat exports of around 10.5 mln tonnes, a new record and nearly double the previous record of 5.9 mln tonnes achieved in the 1984/85 season. Traders expect U.K. Wheat exports to reach 6.0 mln and barley around 4.50 mln tonnes. The Soviet Union has booked a record total of 2.5 mln tonnes of British wheat and barley this season, but only 1.28 mln had surfaced in Customs export figures by March 25, traders said. Other EC countries have bought large amounts of British grain and for the July 1/March 25 period had taken 2.59 mln tonnes of wheat and 2.06 mln tonnes of barley. This compares with 1.28 mln and 868,700 tonnes last season. The market is expecting prices, particularly wheat, to stay buoyant for the remaining few months of the season. If supplies become more difficult and prices strengthen further, feed compounders may increase cereal substitute usage, traders said."

portugal's gdp forecast to grow four pct this year,gnp bop,"Portugal's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will grow around four pct this year, the same rate as in 1986, according to a Bank of Portugal forecast. Total investment this year, the country's second as a member of the European Community (EC), will rise nearly 10 pct, again the same rate as last year, the central bank study said. It added that Portugal's current account was forecast to show a surplus of 400 mln dlrs this year compared with 1.13 billion in 1986 and 369 mln the previous year. Last year's high surplus was attributed to cheaper oil and raw materials, lower world interest rates and a weaker dollar. Imports by volume were forecast to grow 10 pct this year and exports four pct compared with increases of 16.5 pct and 6.6 pct respectively in 1986, the bank said. The forecasts were calculated on the assumption that the non-expansionary monetary policy carried out by the current government would be maintained, particularly in budget spending and income and in wage policy. The bank added that the 1987 forecasts were also based on the assumption that the international economic situation and Portugal's world trade relations would remain more or less the same as in 1986. The central bank said the high rate of investment estimated for 1986 was due to government policies and to increasing optimism among firms whose financial situation had improved since 1985. This tendency was expected to continue this year, especially in the construction and public works sectors. Financial aid from the EC had also helped to boost investment last year, the bank said."

u.s. scientists say tropical oils health risk,veg-oil palm-oil coconut-oil,"U.S. scientists said some tropical vegetable oils can be hazardous to consumers whose health is at risk because of high levels of saturated fat, lending weight to a campaign by the American Soybean Association (ASA) for labelling changes. The scientists appeared to support an ASA charge, denied by Malaysian palm growers, that imported coconut, palm and palm kernel oils contain high levels of saturated fat and thus raise blood cholesterol and the risk of heart disease. In a petition filed in January, the ASA asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to require palm, palm kernel and coconut oils to be identified as saturated fats on food manufacturers' labels. The FDA responded to the ASA in a letter saying it would consider the petition as a comment to a proposed rule dealing with cholesterol and fatty acid labelling of foods. Malaysian oil palm growers have said the charges by the ASA that palm oil consumption increases blood cholesterol and contributes to heart disease are untrue. But Steve Chang, Professor of Food Science at Rutgers University, said, ""Palm oil is definitely not good for human health because it has a high content of saturated fatty acid."" He added that the higher the fatty acid, the greater the blood cholesterol level. ""It has been well established that high cholesterol levels will have a higher level of heart disease,"" he said. A Malaysian Oil Palm Growers Council official, Borge Bek-Nielsen, has said studies have shown that palm oil is cholesterol-free, low in saturated fats, has anti-cancer properties and prevents blood clotting and blocking of arteries in humans. Bek-Nielsen said Americans consume more saturated fats daily through food like butter, bacon, ham and beef than from palm oil, which, he added is rich in vitamins A and E. David Kritchevsky, Associate Director of the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, appeared to take the ASA view on labelling. ""What people really have to learn is to read labels,"" said Kritchevsky. ""The more a consumer knows, the more likely he will make an intelligent choice."" The U.S. scientists said they had no doubt imported palm, palm kernel and coconut oils contain high saturated fat levels. Kritchevsky, a specialist in nutrition, said, ""More saturated fat would raise cholesterol levels...So, from that point of view it's a health risk. High cholesterol levels in the blood are a risk factor for heart disease."" Susanne Harris, deputy assistant secretary of the U.S. Agriculture Department's Food and Consumer Services Division, said the health risk among consumers of vegetable oils with high saturated fat levels was highest among those who have heart disease. The scientists said more than 50 pct of the fatty acid content of the tropical oils was saturated, whereas less than 20 pct of the fatty acid content of soybean oil was saturated. David Ericksen, director of ASA's technical services, said U.S. soybean producers could regain about one-half of the 273 mln dlrs in sales lost to imported tropical oils if consumers were aware the vegetable oils were high in saturated fat. Imported tropical oils displace 171 mln bushels of U.S. soybean sales in the U.S. market, ASA estimates. U.S. imports of coconut oil during January totaled 82.9 mln lbs compared with 48.0 mln lbs in December and 106.5 mln a year earlier, according to Commerce Department figures. Imports of palm oil totaled 44.0 mln lbs compared with 51.3 mln lbs in December and 85.2 mln a year earlier."

Long grain acreage as a percentage of total acreage is expected to decline this year, the report said. USDA said factors once supportive of increased long grain acreage have turned around. Domestic prices of medium grain relative to long grain have increased, the loan differential has been greatly reduced and increases in long grain yields relative to those of other classes have leveled off. With the drop in domestic prices resulting from the marketing loan, domestic rice use is expected to grow at a faster rate, USDA said. ""Development of new products and increased promotion have helped make rice more available and visible to a wider range of consumers,"" USDA said. USDA said world trade is expected to fall in 1987 because of large production and stocks but a weaker market should affect competing exporters more than the U.S. ""The United States has already recovered a substantial share of the European Community market and made inroads into markets in the Middle East and Africa,"" the report said. World rice consumption is projected to reach record levels in 1986/87, the report said, as higher per capita incomes, increased domestic production and low import prices have allowed people in many countries to substitute rice for coarse grains. China, India and South Korea have increased output, while the Middle East and Africa have doubled imports since the mid-1970s, the report said."
turkey eligible for u.s. bonus rice,grain rice,"The U.S. Agriculture Department said Turkey has been made eligible for the sale of up to 70,000 tonnes of medium grain milled rice under the department's export enhancement program, EEP.

international lpg prices mixed,nat-gas propane,"International LPG prices were mixed in the past week, with North Sea prices easier while prices in the Mediterranean and the Gulf were up in April, traders said. In the North Sea market, small cargoes of propane were sold as high as 126 dlrs per tonne on the f.o.b. basis early in the week, but prices eased after the majors posted their April contract prices, traders said. British Petroleum plc <BP> left propane unchanged at 110 dlrs and raised butane prices 5.50 dlrs to 123 dlrs, Shell, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD> <ST> raised propane three dlrs to 113 and butane 5.50 dlrs to 123 dlrs, they said. In the Mediterranean, prices firm in Lavera as Algerian supplies were not always available. Spot propane was unchanged, while butane rose about 25 dlrs from last week, traders said. They said, however, the Mediterranean butane market was very thin, making it subject to wide price swings. In the Gulf, strong demand from the Far East pushed premium on small cargoes five to 10 dlrs above government selling price (gsp) for propane and 10 dlrs for butane, traders said. The rising premium over gsp, however, was partially offset by about 10 pct decline in shipping, making prices for propane about unchanged and butane five dlrs higher, basis c. and f.

u.s. meat processors ask for labelling change,livestock carcass,"Four U.S. meat processors have asked the federal government to relax a labelling requirement which they said discourages the use of mechanically separated meat, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. The petition, filed by Bob Evans Farms, Odom Sausage Co, Sara Lee Corp and Owens Country Sausage, asks USDA to allow mechanically separated meat to be listed on product labels as the species from which it was derived. For example, ""pork"" would be listed on the ingredients statement instead of ""mechanically separated pork."" Under the petition, the calcium content of the meat product would have to be stated on the label and the mechanically separated meat could constitute no more than 10 pct of the meat and poultry portion of the product. Mechanically separated meat is a high-protein, low-cost product that has been approved for use since 1978, USDA said. Current regulations allow use of mechanically separated ingredients at levels up to 20 pct of the meat and poultry product, but require it to be listed in the ingredient statement as ""mechanically separated (species),"" USDA said. USDA said the petitioning firms claimed companies avoid using mechanically separated meat in their products because the term carries an ""unwarranted negative connotation"" in the minds of many consumers. The petitioners also noted that no similar regulation exists for poultry products. Mechanically separated meat is made by placing carcass parts, which usually have been hand-trimmed but still have some remaining meat, into specialized processing equipment."

peru says it intends to deepen debt stance,gnp gas,"President Alan Garcia said he sought to deepen Peru's hard-line foreign debt stance, possibly by limiting repayments to the World Bank. In a televised address tonight, he criticised the World Bank for making Peru make larger debt payments than the amount the bank is willing to make in new loans. ""We will deepen our policy on the foreign debt,"" he said. Peru has limited foreign debt repayments to 10 pct of export earnings, effectively suspending most remittances due foreign private banks and many governments. It has generally been current for most of Garcia's 20 months in office on payments to the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. But tonight Garcia said: ""We have met our aim of limiting the payment of the debt and will limit it also even though organisations like the World Bank have credits which oblige us to buy a certain type of machinery and to build certain types of public works and not others, and to pay much more in dollars than that which they are willing to newly lend us."" The Economy Ministry said last year it owed the World Bank about 520 mln dlrs in loans out of the country's 14 billion dlr debt. Garcia said his government had been a model for Latin America because Peru had enjoyed growth in gross domestic product (GDP) last year of nine pct while taking its hard line on debt. He said GDP would grow by at least six pct this year. He announced an immediate 40 pct rise in the minimum wage to 1,260 intis per month, benefiting the 1.3 mln minimum-wage workers out of a total labour force of 6.7 mln. Salaries will go up this month by 30 pct for civil servants and 27 pct for those workers earning above the minimum wage but not covered by collective bargaining agreements. He also said the price of petrol, frozen since August 1, 1985, would increase by 20 pct from the current 17.5 intis per U.S. Gallon and remain at the new level for the rest of the year. He did not say when this increase would be effective. Taxes on petrol are the government's leading revenue earner, traditionally accounting for about one-third of taxes. Sales taxes on autos, liquour and cigarettes would also go up, he said, without specifying the amount. Garcia announced the government would encourage Peruvians to repatriate their savings deposited abroad by paying a 15 pct premium above the market exchange rate. The inti's official buy-sell rate against the dollar is 14.85/92 and the free rate is about 21.70/80. To encourage private investment, he said the government would set up a special fund with which it would match every two intis of private investment with one inti from the government. He also said his dismissal of Peruvian Air Force Commander Lieutenant General Luis Abram Cavarellino yesterday strengthened the democratic authority of his government."

The companies involved would be exempted from corporate tax and property transfer and registration taxes. Under the programme, five subsidaries of <Chung Woo Development Co Ltd> will be taken over by <Byuck San Corp>, <Korea Develpoment Corp> by <Daelim Industrial Co Ltd>, and two subsidaries of <Korea Shipping Corp> by the <Hanjin Group>. Another five construction companies were ordered to improve their financial status by reorganising their subsidiaries or selling off unproductive real estate holdings to help repay bank loans, the officials said. These are <Pacific Construction Co Ltd>, <Life Construction Co Ltd>, <Chin Heung International Co Ltd>, <Samick Co Ltd> and <Hanshin Construction Co Ltd>.

They said the government would take similar measures for more companies in August in line with the continuing realignment policy, which had already affected 56 firms last year."
opposition leader warns of famine in bangladesh,grain rice wheat,"The failure of the Bangladesh government to tackle the country's current food crisis could lead to a famine, the leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, Khaleda Zia, told a press conference yesterday. Prices of rice rose by at least 25 pct across the country in March and the government has begun emergency rice and wheat sales to lower cereal prices, a food ministry report said. Ministry officials said the next harvest, due in mid-April will ease the situation. ""Temporary grain shortage in the arid north and some other rain-starved regions is not unusual at this time of the year,"" one official said. Khaleda, said corrupt practices by food officials and failure to procure enough grains contributed to the crisis. Her remarks coincided with newspaper reports that a continuing heat wave has destroyed thousands of acres of crops in the south-west. Officials said last week Bangladesh now has only 390,000 tonnes of grain in stock which would be exhausted in two or three weeks. Bangladesh expects to produce 14.5 mln tonnes of rice and 1.5 mln tonnes of wheat in 1986/87 ending June 30. It revised its food import target for this fiscal year upward by 300,000 tonnes to 1.8 mln."
"u.s. to press for faster japanese, german growth",trade gnp,"The U.S. Administration, under Congressional pressure to cut the trade deficit, will urge Tokyo and Bonn to meet commitments to speed economic growth to stabilise currencies at Wednesday's meetings of leading industrial nations in Washington, monetary sources said. The U.S. Will also try to develop proposals made at the 1986 Tokyo Summit for measures to ensure agreements such as the Paris Accord are more binding, they said. Treasury Secretary James Baker's dual initiatives reflect U.S. Frustration with the two countries for not moving fast enough to curb their huge trade surpluses, they added. Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa is expected to bring the outline of an economic stimulus package to the meeting, which will be attended by West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada as well as the U.S. And Japan, the sources said. ""The sooner the Japanese can announce their intention to announce a stimulative package,the better it is for Japan and for the exchange markets in general,"" one of the sources said. Treasury Secretary James Baker said the Paris Agreement, in which West Germany and Japan made their commitments, will be renewed by the industrial countries this week. Other U.S. Officials said a meeting of the Group of Seven will be a status report on progress Bonn and Tokyo have made setting up stimulus measures. The U.S. Will tell its partners that it expects a further substantial budget deficit reduction package to be agreed with Congress this year, the sources said. Washington would like its economic partners to establish specific economic policy goals. Sharp deviations from the set objectives would trigger consultations among the countries on appropriate corrective action, they added. The Paris accord envisaged surplus countries like Japan and West Germany stimulating domestic demand to absorb more imports and the U.S. Cutting its budget deficit, thereby depressing its demand for imports. But the markets are signalling the dollar's floor may be far below its level at the time the Paris agreement was struck, the sources said. Monetary sources also said the dollar's recent sharp fall against the yen reflected the U.S.-Japanese dispute over semi-conductor trade which resulted in U.S. Tariffs on certain Japanese electronic goods. One of the sources said the dispute has to some extent soured the atmosphere ahead of the meetings. Congressional sentiment for protectionist measures, aimed particularly at Japan, has strengthened, the sources said."

Saito said the government's package should include plans to remove residual import restrictions on agricultural products and to lift tariffs on industrial products. Leading industrialised countries should also step up concerted market intervention to stabilize exchange rates, Saito said. The measures will be presented to Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone as a joint proposal of Keidanren, the Japan Federation of Employers' Association, the Japan Committee for Economic Development and the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Saito said Japan should stop paying only lip service to its pledges to open its markets. The proposed measures should be undertaken by increased fiscal spending, he added."

"chinese crops hit by frost, snow and rain in march",grain oilseed wheat rapeseed,"Wheat and rapeseed crops in east China suffered considerable damage because of frost during a spell of unusually cold weather in late March, the China Daily said. It said average temperatures for the last 10 days of March in most of east China were three to five degrees centigrade below average. Snow fell in Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei and Henan, making early rice sowing difficult. Heavy snow blanketted central and south Jilin and north Liaoning, leaving farmland too muddy for spring ploughing and sowing, the paper said. The paper said rainfall during the last 10 days of March in areas south of the Yangtze had been much higher than normal. Heavy rain fell last Sunday in parts of Guangdong, ending a particularly arid dry season and marking the start of the flood season, it said. It gave no further details. The New China News Agency said rain and snow in Henan had improved the prospects for wheat, sown on 4.8 mln hectares, and caused a drop in grain prices at rural fairs since late February. It gave no 1986 figures for comparison."

"no intervention, dollar fixed at 1.8218 marks",money-fx dlr,"The Bundesbank did not intervene as the dollar was fixed lower at 1.8218 marks after 1.8243 yesterday, dealers said. Dealers said dollar trading was very quiet over the European morning, with operators made wary by today's meeting of the Group of Five finance ministers and central bank chiefs ahead of the full IMF/World Bank session in Washington. It was undermined by remarks from U.S. Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Beryl Sprinkel who told Iowa bankers the U.S. Had no objective regarding the value of the dollar. Sprinkel also called the reference to stabilizing exchange rates at about current levels, made at the Paris meeting on February 22, a ""vague statement,"" casting doubt on operators' assumptions that a secret target level had been set. Sprinkel added that if West Germany and Japan made progress to stimulate their economies as the Paris agreement envisaged, ""there would not be the necessity of significant declines in the dollar."" One dealer for a U.S.-based bank noted the dollar tended easier after the remarks. ""They were obviously regarded as being negative. And if the market starts regarding anything that comes out negatively then it means that the underlying sentiment is negative,"" he said. Some early selling pressure softened the dollar's undertone. Most operators overlooked intervention by the Bank of Japan to support the dollar against selling in favour of the yen by institutional investors and overseas operators, dealers said. After the strong focus on the dollar/yen rate in recent weeks up to the end of the Japanese financial year on March 31, interest and activity was likely to switch, dealers said. ""We can start to look at a point in time where the interest shifts away from dollar/yen and more into dollar/mark and the other European currencies,"" the U.S. Bank dealer said. Despite the softer undertone, traders would remain wary of taking significant new positions during the Washington meetings, dealers said. Aside from the G-5 session today, Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl is due to meet the German Affairs group on international monetary issues later. The mark gained some strength from news the Bundesbank set a new securities repurchase tender to add money market liquidity at a fixed 3.80 pct, unchanged from those over the last several weeks. Some expectation had been growing that it might cut the rate or move to a minimum interest rate tender, signalling a desire for a slight easing in credit policy. Bundesbank central bank council member Lothar Mueller said the Bundesbank had not given up its focus on money supply. A monetary policy which took into account exchange rates and capital flows could not be confused with an exchange-rate oriented policy, he said, contradicting some growing sentiment. Sterling eased a touch to 2.950 marks at the fixing from 2.957. The yen's unabated strength, despite the intervention, brought it up to 1.2555 marks per 100 from yesterday's 1.2480. The Swiss franc rose to a fix of 120.515 marks per 100 from 120.180. The French franc eased to 30.055 marks per 100 after 30.060, Belgian franc was little changed at 4.829 marks per 100."
kuwait may re-register gulf tankers - newspaper,crude ship,"Kuwait may re-register part of its tanker fleet with foreign flag jurisdictions, including the U.S. And USSR, in an attempt to protect them from Iranian missile attacks in the Gulf war zone, U.S. Officials were quoted by the New York Times as saying. The transfers would allow the country of registration to escort Kuwaiti-owned ships in the Gulf. Kuwait had earlier declined an offer of U.S. Naval escorts as too public an admission of its need for protection, they said. Kuwait is also looking at flagging-out to European registries, the officials said. Soviet flag tankers transporting Kuwaiti oil through the Gulf may get Soviet escorts, the officials said. Kuwait had earlier considered having both USSR and U.S. Escorts, but the U.S. Was unwilling to give the Soviet Union a naval role in the region, the newspaper quoted the officials as saying. Kuwait has backed Iraq in the seven-year war against Iran and its ships have increasingly been the target of Iranian attacks. The U.S. And Kuwait have been negotiating for over a month on methods of protecting Kuwaiti ships."

palm oil output seen dropping sharply - oil world,veg-oil palm-oil,"Malaysian and Indonesian palm oil production is likely to drop sharply this year, due to lower yields, the Hamburg-based newsletter Oil World said. The publication expects total Malaysian output during Jan/Sept 1987 to decline by eight pct to 3.05 mln tonnes. For East Malaysia, it put production during the period at 297,000 tonnes after 312,000 a year earlier and for West Malaysia 2.75 mln compared with just over 3.0 mln during Jan/Sept 1986. It said new plantings had slowed markedly in both countries, but the effects of this will not be felt until 1988-90. Above normal yields during recent years resulted in trees reacting to the stress by changing the sex ratio to more male inflorescences and/or aborting more female, Oil World said. Yields per hectare are also likely to be adversely affected this year by insufficient rain up to 25 months ago. This could especially affect trees in West Malaysia during April/June, while in East Malaysia the impact will be in February/April and July/Dec, and in Indonesia July/Sept. Last year's cut in fertilizer use will hit this year's yields and bigger effects are expected within the next three years, Oil World said without elaborating. Opening stocks in West Malaysia at the start of this year were put at only 565,000 tonnes compared with 914,000 in January 1986, Oil World said. West Malaysian net exports are therefore expected to drop 500,000 tonnes to 2.54 mln during Jan/Sept, while those of East Malaysia are likely to decline by 10 pct to 280,000 tonnes. Indonesian palm oil production is forecast to fall about eight pct during Jan/May, but to rise from June on. Overall Indonesian output during Jan/Sept is forecast to rise three pct to 933,000 tonnes. Indonesian stocks as of April 1, however, are put at only 65,000 tonnes compared with 160,000 a year ago. Indonesian export commitments and domestic requirements are both running at high levels, Oil World said, and it expects the country's imports to reach a record 110,000 tonnes during Jan/Sept. The bulk of this will arrive during Feb/May, ahead of the April elections and the religious Ramadan festival throughout May, it said. Indonesian net exports, therefore, may fall by 29 pct to 350,000 tonnes, Oil World said. The possibility that recent Indonesian palm oil purchases will not actually enter the country but be transshipped to other countries to fulfill Indonesia's export orders cannot be ruled out, it said."

"ruding against further dollar fall, trade curbs",money-fx dlr trade,"Shifts in domestic economic policy, not a further fall in the dollar or trade restrictions, are the key to reducing imbalances in trade and payments, Dutch Finance Miniister H. Onno Ruding said. Ruding told a meeting of the World Trade Forum here that protectionism would naturally lead to retaliation and aggravate the problems of heavily indebted developing countries. ""The main contribution towards resolving the still enourmous U.S. trade deficit is not repeat not a further fall in the dollar, is not still more protectionism in your country."" ""No, it is - like in other countries - changes in domestic economic and financial policies,"" Ruding said. Ruding said he was less worried about a crisis of the weakening dollar than he was in January before the Paris accord to stabilize foreign exchange rates. He said the highest priority should be given to policy changes in the United States, especially reducing the budget deficit and encouraging domestic savings. But he said other countries, such as Japan and West Germany, also needed to take greater steps toward reducing their trade surpluses."

volcker warns against sizeable dlr decline,money-fx dlr trade,"Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said a further large drop in the value of the dollar could be counterproductive for world economic growth. Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, Volcker said that Europe and Japan were slowing exports and that growth in those countries was also decreasing. ""In that kind of situation, further sizeable depreciation of the dollar could well be counterproductive,"" he said. Domestic expansion in foreign industrial countries has not been enough to offset the effects of slower exports, Volcker said. On the value of the dollar, Volcker said he could not say whether it should be higher or lower to restore balance in trade. ""What we do know is that a substantial exchange rate adjustment has already been made,"" he said. ""That adjustment should be large enough, in a context of a growing world economy and fiscal restraint in the United States, to support the widespread expectations of a narrowing in the real trade deficit in the period ahead,"" he said. Volcker said U.S. exports were now growing substantially while import growth should slow. Volcker said that to improve the trade deficit with a minimum of inflationary pressure, the United States would have to slow its spending growth. It would also have to achieve a better balance between investment and domestic savings if it wants to be able to dispense with foreign capital. ""The constructive way to work in the needed direction would be to reduce our budget deficit, year by year, paving the way for improvements in our trade accounts,"" he said. Relying on depreciation of the dollar alone would risk renewed inflation, he said."

bundesbank retains money supply policy,money-supply money-fx,"Bundesbank council member Lothar Mueller said the bank has not given up its money supply policy and that restraining money supply growth does not always mean pushing up interest rates. Mueller said in an article for the Boersen Zeitung financial daily that a monetary policy which took into account exchange rate expectations and capital flows could not be confused with an exchange rate oriented policy. The article followed international press speculation that the Bundesbank had abandoned money supply targetting in favour of an exchange rate policy. Mueller, a member of the Bundesbank council in his position as president of the regional state central bank in Bavaria, noted that the Bundesbank's decision in January to cut leading interest rates amid continuing strong monetary growth had led some people to think it was dropping monetary targetting. ""Simply to ignore the external economic context would be risky and dangerous for monetary policy,"" he explained. Mueller said the cuts in official interest rates had put an end to interest rate speculation. The Bundesbank could now assume that upward pressure on the mark would ease and currency inflows slow down. Lower money market rates, achieved by widening short and long term interest rate differentials, also encouraged investors to re-invest funds parked in liquid accounts, Mueller said. The measures therefore aimed clearly at bringing monetary growth back onto the desired path, he said. ""Finally, of course, and there is no need to keep this quiet, the cut in interest rates was also in line with the changed economic situation of the last few months,"" he added. ""All in all, the Bundesbank in no way abandoned its money supply policy with the January discount rate cut, despite suppositions to the contrary,"" Mueller said. ""Keeping money supply developments in check is not always synonymous with raising interest rates, especially when excessive liquidity due to inflows from abroad, rather than growth in bank credits, is the cause of rising monetary holdings of non-banks,"" Mueller said. Now that West Germany no longer ran large external deficits other concepts were needed for monetary policy. Mueller said it would be both difficult and dangerous for monetary policy to pursue a specific mark/dollar exchange rate. In any case, the exchange rate partly depends on U.S. Currency and budgetary policy and the U.S. Economy, he said. But an exchange rate orientation would also mean the end of a strict stability policy because both interest rates and liquidity would be affected by required currency intervention and could no longer be steered autonomously by the Bundesbank. Even interest rates are not in the centre of the Bundesbank's considerations, but reflect competition and other market conditions, Mueller said. A cut in bank liquidity will not directly influence central bank money stock, the Bundesbank's main money supply indicator. This does not reflect banking liquidity, but the liquidity of industry and households which cannot be directly reached with the Bundesbank's instruments, Mueller said. The less dependent non-banks are on bank credits, the harder it is to steer money supply. This has increasingly been the case recently, because non-banks have received considerable sums from current account surpluses and capital imports. ""If the Bundesbank had tried to brake the money supply rise with higher interest rates, as would have been appropriate if credit was growing excessively, it would not only have missed its target but probably even set off further inflows,"" he said. Mueller said growth in money supply was still too high. In the last three months money stock grew at an annual rate of seven pct, down from 10 pct in the previous quarter. The growth curve has therefore come closer to the three to six pct 1987 target corridor for central bank money stock growth, pointing to the success of the current policy, he said. But high monetary stocks can be a warning sign and there should be no change in priorities. ""Monetary policy must be first and foremost stability policy and successful stability policy is money supply policy -- nothing else,"" he said."

german long-term capital inflow slumps in february,bop trade,"The inflow of long-term capital into West Germany slumped to 606 mln marks in February from January's record 11.91 billion, with foreign purchases of German bonds and shares declining sharply, the Bundesbank said. While foreigners bought only four billion marks worth of German bonds in February after 13 billion in January, they sold a net 500 mln marks in shares and promissory notes of public authorities after sales worth 300 mln in January. With German investors' purchases of foreign securities steady around 1.3 billion marks, only 2.2 billion marks were imported through securities transactions, after 11.2 billion. Direct investment abroad led to a capital outflow of 1.60 billion marks in February after 2.83 billion in January. There was a deficit of 8.14 billion marks in the short-term capital account after a surplus of 194 mln in January. Banks alone exported some 8.6 billion marks in funds while domestic companies increased their short-term financial assets abroad by 700 mln. But public authorities received some one billion marks from abroad, the Bundesbank said in a statement. Combining long and short term capital outflows, West Germany recorded a net outflow of 7.53 billion marks in February against a net inflow of 11.91 billion in January. The Bundesbank confirmed the German trade surplus widened to 10.45 billion marks in February from January's 7.20 billion. Taking the two months together the seasonally adjusted surplus was slightly below the figure for the previous two. In terms of current as well as constant prices, the narrowing of the surplus was progressing, the bank said. Germany's current account surplus widened to 6.63 billion marks in February from 4.79 billion in January, but was down on the 7.26 billion figure for February 1986. Seasonally adjusted, the February current account surplus narrowed against January. While exports in February fell a half pct against the same month last year, imports fell 10-1/2 pct largely due to the drop in prices. Exports grew three pct in volume and imports two pct. In the balance of services, a fall in net investment income led to a 300 mln mark deficit in February after a 300 mln mark surplus in January. The deficit in transfer payments widened to 3.70 billion marks from 2.69 billion, largely due to a sharp jump to 2.3 billion marks from 200 mln in payments to the European Community budget."
ec sources say uk wheat plan yet to be approved,grain wheat,"The European Commission has not taken a decision on applications from the British government for the release of 200,000 tonnes of intervention feed wheat onto the British market in May and June, Commission sources said. They said last week's cereals management committee agreed to release 70,000 tonnes of feed wheat through weekly tenders between April 14 and May 26. It also indicated it planned to allow the release of another 30,000 tonnes from April 23. However, it decided to leave consideration of the release of further wheat until later. The British government had applied for the release of a further 100,000 tonnes in both May and June from British intervention stores to prevent market prices rising. However, the sources said, the Commission wanted to review the market situation nearer the time before giving its approval. The Commission was given new powers last year to control the release of intervention cereals onto the market, the sources noted. Following last week's committee meeting, the U.K. Ministry of Agriculture said the Commission had given an assurance that additional quantities of intervention wheat would be made available in May and June. It also said that it was envisaged that monthly releases would be at least 100,000 tonnes, depending on the state of the market. This lead to the widespread assumption that the Commission had actually approved the release of 300,000 tonnes during the three months of April, May and June at last week's meeting."
dutch money market debt rises in week,money-fx reserves,"Loans and advances from the Dutch Central Bank to the commercial banks rose by 1.2 billion guilders to 10.7 billion in the week up to and including April 6, the Bank's weekly return showed. Paper discounted with the Bank also rose, by 477 mln guilders to 916 mln. These rises were balanced by a 1.6 billion guilders rise in the Treasury's account at the Bank, made up mainly of repayments on housing loans by local authorities. The Treasury's account stood at 8.1 billion guilders, the weekly return showed. The Bank's gold and currency reserves rose by 484 mln to 56.89 billion guilders, while the value of non-gold holdings rose by 140 mln guilders, analysts said. They added that the rise in the reserves was merely the result of commercial currency transactions by the Bank. Call money and period tariffs were only fractionally changed this week and were seen sustaining their stable levels since no dramatic changes in the money market debt, currently around 10.25 billion guilders, are expected. Today call money traded between 5-3/8 to 5-1/2 pct and period tariffs all between 5-5/16 to 5-7/16 pct."

u.s. immigration rules spark congress objections,sugar livestock,"New immigration rules relating to alien farm workers and reportedly being drafted by the U.S. Agriculture Department are meeting with objections in Congress, sources on Capitol Hill said. USDA is drafting regulations, required by a 1986 law, that would offer amnesty to illegal aliens if they worked in the cultivation of fruits, vegetables and other perishable commodities. The department is considering including in its definition of perishable commodities such farm products as tobacco, hops, Spanish reeds and Christmas trees, while excluding sugar cane, the New York Times reported yesterday. Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., would like to see the definition extended to include sugar cane, cultivation of which is ""a breeding ground for one of the scandals of the nation,"" Gene Smith, a spokesman for Berman, said. Livestock, dairy and poultry producers have been lobbying USDA hard to have their products covered by the amnesty provision, farm industry sources said. Chuck Fields of the American Farm Bureau Federation said livestock producers were ""desperate"" because they fear they will be unable to retain the many illegal aliens who have joined that industry. A House staff member involved in drafting the landmark 1986 immigration law who asked not to be identified said Congress did not mean to extend special amnesty provisions to workers who helped cultivate tobacco, and that inclusion of hops and Spanish reeds was ""marginal."" In addition, lawmakers made it clear during consideration of the bill that lumber workers were not to be covered by the the amnesty provisions, making the inclusion of Christmas trees ""a tough call,"" this source said. USDA officials declined to comment on the draft regulation except to say it was subject to change before it will be released, probably some time later this month. While lawmakers may object to the USDA rule under consideration relating to perishable commodities, Congress is not likely to reopen debate on the controversial immigration question, congressional sources said. The amnesty provision specially designed for farm workers was crucial to passage of the overall immigration bill. Congressional staff members estimate the special farm worker amnesty provision would apply to between 250,000 to 350,000 aliens. The law would allow eligible farm workers who worked for 90 days during the year ending May 1, 1986, to apply for temporary, then permanent, resident status."

The department said the action was taken at the request of Iraq's State Trade Organization for Grains and Foodstuffs. The guarantee line for sales of corn has been reduced from 78.0 mln dlrs to 57.0 mln and the line for oilseeds from 5.0 mln dlrs to zero.

"supplies, mideast tension fuel gains in oil",crude gas heat,"Petroleum futures rallied today in a market that was expecting declines in domestic supplies and became further unsettled by escalated Mideast fighting. Crude oil, gasoline and heating oil all posted gains on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with crude oil prices matching life-of-contract highs. Crude for delivery in May closed 17 cents higher at 18.84 dlrs a barrel. ""Crude futures could jump above 19 dlrs a barrel but will not remain there long if products are not strong,"" Robert Murphy, account executive at E.F. Hutton, said. Traders said prices were supported by anticipation that the American Petroleum Institute would report a decline in domestic inventories of petroleum products in a weekly report. Traders said prices also were supported by an escalation in the Iran-Iraq war, with the Iranians reportedly launching a new offensive against Iraqi positions, and Iraq attacking offshore oil fields and an oil export depot. Buying by speculators continued to prompt gains in gold and silver futures on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Gold prices retreated at midday, but rallied before the close with support from the silver market, which was approaching two-year highs, traders said. Soybean futures posted strong gains on the Chicago Board of Trade, while corn and wheat were mostly higher. Traders said cash sales have been slow in the country, and the soybean harvest in Brazil has been delayed by rain, which is limiting supplies. In addition, the Agriculture Department last week projected a substantial drop in soybean acreage this year. Monday's report that the USDA inspected 46 mln bushels of corn for export last week was unexpectedly high and, coupled with a lack of farm sales, provided support for the corn market, traders said. Live hogs and frozen pork bellies rallied on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while cattle ended lower. Live hogs pushed ahead on a lack of supplies because many farmers are turning their attention to spring planting rather than marketing livestock, traders said, noting that cash sales have been lighter than expected this week. The lack of marketing also has supported pork bellies, but prices drifted lower for moderate losses in nearby months as speculators sold contracts to take profits, traders said. Cattle prices closed lower but continued to show strength related to tight supplies. Prices pushed ahead to new contract highs, extending gains past three-year peaks set Monday, as tight supplies forced meat packers to bid aggressively for available animals. However, some traders sold contracts to take profits after the extended rally, which has seen the April delivery contract soar to 69.90 cents a pound from 56 cents a pound at the start of the year. New York coffee futures closed higher on trade talk Brazil would not be an aggressive seller near term, analysts said."

""If they (the finance ministers) give the market something really new to look at -- that is, some package that goes beyond the Paris agreement -- you could have a real boost in the dollar,"" said Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst Anne Mills. On the other hand, ""anything neutral would tend to be bearish for the dollar,"" Mills said. Traders and analysts agree a simple reaffirmation of the Paris accord will not be enough to halt the decline in the dollar, nor will central bank intervention.

""If there is no concrete resolution, they will be looking to sell the dollar, possibly down to the 1.80 mark level,"" he said. Technically, most currency futures are poised for another rise, said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig Sloane. Sloane noted that June yen futures set a new contract high on Tuesday and closed at its best level ever, while June sterling set a new contract high on Monday. ""Everything seems to be coming to a head right now and you don't need much to get things rolling,"" Sloane said. In particular, the June Canadian dollar, for which Sloane recently put out a buy recommendation, has hovered in a range between 0.7600 and 0.7660 in recent weeks, forming a triangle on the charts from which it may soon break out on the upside. A close above the contract high of 0.7665 would signal a breakout, Sloane said, and would likely mean the nearby Canadian dollar contract would extend its advance to near the 0.7800 level. June Canadian dollar closed at 0.7656 Tuesday. Mills noted, however, that interest rate differentials between Canadian securities and U.S. securities have narrowed dramatically recently, with yields on 10-year Canadian bonds only about 80 basis points above U.S. 10-year notes. What has helped the Canadian currency, she noted, is an increasing proportion of foreign funds flowing into the Canadian equity market, particularly from Japanese investors. Other analysts, however, said currency futures may be near the top of their long-term rally. ""Something will be done at the (G-5 and G-7) meeting to calm people,"" said David Horner of Merrill Lynch Economics. The Paris accord has pretty much fixed where major European currencies will trade, Horner said. But sterling futures may still make another run for new highs, up to 1.6300 to 1.6500 dlr in the June contract, on the positive atmosphere that will prevail before British elections and possibly another interest rate cut, Horner said. The June British pound closed at 1.6080 on Tuesday. Horner said that new boundaries for the trading range of the yen are likely to come out of the G-5 and G-7 meetings. The most likely range will be a bottom for the dollar between 140 to 142 yen per dollar and a top near 150 to 152 yen, Horner said. In yen futures, the bottom of the dollar's range would be equivalent to 0.007100 to 0.007150 in the June contract. June yen closed at 0.006913 on Tuesday. If such a range does emerge from the meetings, ""we will have one more rally in the yen,"" Horner said."
poehl warns against further dollar fall,dlr money-fx trade cpi money-supply,"Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation of the mark would damage prospects for sustained West German economic growth. In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs here, Poehl said ""It would be an extremely risky policy to aim for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to correct the trade deficit."" He said the United States could face a vicious circle of depreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took that route. Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet U.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy, accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and tolerating above-target money supply growth. He said he would have been happy to have brought forward five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to the beginning of this year, but he said the government faced political constraints getting such measures through the upper house of the West German parliament. But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could accept on exports from a rising mark, he said. Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about one-third of its gross national product, so a substantial erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing demand at home. ""A further appreciation of the mark could even be an obstacle to further growth,"" he said. Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and because external factors, including low oil prices and favourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway. But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma over monetary policy. The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not the reported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germany was affected more than before by exchange rate developments. ""For the time being, we will have to focus our policy more on the external side, and we can live with a more expansionary money supply. But we must be very careful,"" he said. He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan's trade surpluses, which affected European countries as well as the United States. Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary officials of major industrialized countries, saying the importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange rates had been underestimated. All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the right level, and that further changes would damage growth, he said. ""This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on the part of our American colleagues,"" he said. But he said there was still a danger that the correction of the dollar's value could overshoot."

japan to revise long-term energy demand downwards,crude nat-gas,"The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) will revise its long-term energy supply/demand outlook by August to meet a forecast downtrend in Japanese energy demand, ministry officials said. MITI is expected to lower the projection for primary energy supplies in the year 2000 to 550 mln kilolitres (kl) from 600 mln, they said. The decision follows the emergence of structural changes in Japanese industry following the rise in the value of the yen and a decline in domestic electric power demand. MITI is planning to work out a revised energy supply/demand outlook through deliberations of committee meetings of the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, the officials said. They said MITI will also review the breakdown of energy supply sources, including oil, nuclear, coal and natural gas. Nuclear energy provided the bulk of Japan's electric power in the fiscal year ended March 31, supplying an estimated 27 pct on a kilowatt/hour basis, followed by oil (23 pct) and liquefied natural gas (21 pct), they noted."
thai trade deficit widens in first quarter,trade grain rice corn sugar tin rubber,"Thailand's trade deficit widened to 4.5 billion baht in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.1 billion a year ago, the Business Economics Department said. It said Janunary/March imports rose to 65.1 billion baht from 58.7 billion. Thailand's improved business climate this year resulted in a 27 pct increase in imports of raw materials and semi-finished products. The country's oil import bill, however, fell 23 pct in the first quarter due to lower oil prices. The department said first quarter exports expanded to 60.6 billion baht from 56.6 billion. Export growth was smaller than expected due to lower earnings from many key commodities including rice whose earnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26 pct and canned pineapples seven pct. Products registering high export growth were jewellery up 64 pct, clothing 57 pct and rubber 35 pct."
indonesia sees cpo price rising sharply,veg-oil palm-oil,"Indonesia expects crude palm oil (CPO) prices to rise sharply to between 450 and 550 dlrs a tonne FOB sometime this year because of better European demand and a fall in Malaysian output, Hasrul Harahap, junior minister for tree crops, told Indonesian reporters. Prices of Malaysian and Sumatran CPO are now around 332 dlrs a tonne CIF for delivery in Rotterdam, traders said. Harahap said Indonesia would maintain its exports, despite making recent palm oil purchases from Malaysia, so that it could possibly increase its international market share. Indonesia, the world's second largest producer of palm oil after Malaysia, has been forced to import palm oil to ensure supplies during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan. Harahap said it was better to import to cover a temporary shortage than to lose export markets. Indonesian exports of CPO in calendar 1986 were 530,500 tonnes, against 468,500 in 1985, according to central bank figures."
indonesian commodity exchange may expand,veg-oil palm-oil lumber coffee rubber,"The Indonesian Commodity Exchange is likely to start trading in at least one new commodity, and possibly two, during calendar 1987, exchange chairman Paian Nainggolan said. He told Reuters in a telephone interview that trading in palm oil, sawn timber, pepper or tobacco was being considered. Trading in either crude palm oil (CPO) or refined palm oil may also be introduced. But he said the question was still being considered by Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh and no decision on when to go ahead had been made. The fledgling exchange currently trades coffee and rubber physicals on an open outcry system four days a week. ""Several factors make us move cautiously,"" Nainggolan said. ""We want to move slowly and safely so that we do not make a mistake and undermine confidence in the exchange."" Physical rubber trading was launched in 1985, with coffee added in January 1986. Rubber contracts are traded FOB, up to five months forward. Robusta coffee grades four and five are traded for prompt delivery and up to five months forward, exchange officials said. The trade ministry and exchange board are considering the introduction of futures trading later for rubber, but one official said a feasibility study was needed first. No decisions are likely until after Indonesia's elections on April 23, traders said. Trade Minister Saleh said on Monday that Indonesia, as the world's second largest producer of natural rubber, should expand its rubber marketing effort and he hoped development of the exchange would help this. Nainggolan said that the exchange was trying to boost overseas interest by building up contacts with end-users. He said teams had already been to South Korea and Taiwan to encourage direct use of the exchange, while a delegation would also visit Europe, Mexico and some Latin American states to encourage participation. Officials say the infant exchange has made a good start although trading in coffee has been disappointing. Transactions in rubber between the start of trading in April 1985 and December 1986 totalled 9,595 tonnes, worth 6.9 mln dlrs FOB, plus 184.3 mln rupiah for rubber delivered locally, the latest exchange report said. Trading in coffee in calendar 1986 amounted to only 1,905 tonnes in 381 lots, valued at 6.87 billion rupiah. Total membership of the exchange is now nine brokers and 44 traders."

bundesbank allocates 6.1 billion marks in tender,money-fx interest,"The Bundesbank accepted bids for 6.1 billion marks at today's tender for a 28-day securities repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct, a central bank spokesman said. Banks, which bid for a total 12.2 billion marks liquidity, will be credited with the funds allocated today and must buy back securities pledged on May 6. Some 14.9 billion marks will drain from the market today as an earlier pact expires, so the Bundesbank is effectively withdrawing a net 8.1 billion marks from the market with today's allocation. A Bundesbank spokesman said in answer to enquiries that the withdrawal of funds did not reflect a tightening of credit policy, but was to be seen in the context of plentiful liquidity in the banking system. Banks held an average 59.3 billion marks at the Bundesbank over the first six days of the month, well clear of the likely April minimum reserve requirement of 51 billion marks. The Bundesbank spokesman noted that by bidding only 12.2 billion marks, below the outgoing 14.9 billion, banks themselves had shown they felt they had plenty of liquidity. Dealers said the Bundesbank is keen to prevent too much liquidity accruing in the market, as that would blunt the effectiveness of the security repurchase agreement, its main open-market instrument for steering market interest rates. Two further pacts are likely this month over the next two weeks. The Bundesbank is currently steering call money between 3.6 and 3.8 pct, although short-term fluctuations outside that range are possible, dealers said."
bond corp still considering atlas mining bail-out,acq copper,"Bond Corp Holdings Ltd <BONA.S> and Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corp <ATLC.MN> are still holding talks on a bail-out package for the troubled mining firm, an Atlas statement said. Atlas, the Philippines' biggest copper producer, said it had been hit by depressed world copper prices. It reported a net loss of 976.38 mln pesos in the year ending December 1986, compared with a net loss of 1.53 billion in 1985. The company said it had been able to cut its losses because its scaled-down copper operations in the central island of Cebu started in the second half of 1986. Atlas said negotiations were continuing on the acquisition by Bond of the company's existing bank loans and their restructuring into a gold loan. A memorandum of understanding signed by the two sides in October last year said Bond would acquire Atlas' total loans of 275 mln dlrs, to be repaid by the mining company in gold. Atlas said the two sides were also discussing equity infusion into Atlas and the creation of a development fund for further exploration and development of the company's gold properties in the central province of Masbate. Wilson Banks, general manager of <Bond Corp International Ltd> in Hong Kong, told Reuters the Atlas statement on the negotiations was ""reasonably accurate."" Banks said Bond Corp was seriously considering several investments in the Philippines but did not give details. In its statement, Atlas said development of the pre-World War Two underground mines in Masbate had been accelerated and the ore tonnage had increased, extending the operation's life at least until 1993."
japan ministry says open farm trade would hit u.s.,trade rice livestock carcass grain corn oilseed soybean,"Japan's Agriculture Ministry, angered by U.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market, will tell U.S. Officials at talks later this month that liberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan, a senior ministry official said. ""Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drives by other suppliers,"" the official, who declined to be named, said. ""Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products and it is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberalise its farm import market,"" he said. Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S. Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also open its wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated to protect local farmers. Australia and Canada could then increase their wheat exports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said. End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due to visit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will ask Japan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers and remove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports. Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Market share here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, has been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year beef accord next March 31. Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased sales from China and South America, while Japanese soybean imports from Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, although the U.S. Will remain the largest supplier. U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its beef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain imports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said. An indication of the U.S. Position came last December when Under Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S. Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representing some one billion dlrs in new business. The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import controls on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices, purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts, prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans. To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan's top business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove residual import restrictions on agricultural products. But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotional reaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issue should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the industrial sector. ""Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and these issues should not be discussed on the same table,"" the official said."
u.k. money market deficit forecast at 250 mln stg,money-fx interest,"The Bank of England said it forecast a shortage of around 250 mln stg in the money market today. Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain some 505 mln stg, while bills for repurchase by the market will remove around 194 mln. In addition, a rise in note circulation and bankers' balances below target will each drain around 110 mln stg. Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions will add some 690 mln stg to the system today."
south korea moves to slow growth of trade surplus,trade bop,"South Korea's trade surplus is growing too fast and the government has started taking steps to slow it down, Deputy Prime Minister Kim Mahn-je said. He told a press conference the government planned to increase investment, speed up the opening of the local market to foreign imports and gradually adjust its currency to hold the surplus ""at a proper level."" But he said the government would not allow the won to appreciate too much in a short period of time. South Korea has been under pressure from Washington to revalue the won. The U.S. Wants South Korea to cut its trade surplus with the U.S., Which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3 billion dlrs in 1985. Kim, who is also economic planning minister, said prospects were bright for the South Korean economy, but the government would try to hold the current account surplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next five years. ""Our government projections of eight pct GNP growth, five billion dlrs of (current account) surplus and 12 pct growth in exports all seemed to be reasonable early this year. But now the surplus is growing faster than we expected,"" he said. Trade ministry officials said South Korea's exports rose 35 pct to 9.34 billion dlrs in the first three months of this year, while imports rose only 8.5 pct to 8.2 billion dlrs. Kim said the swing of South Korea's current account to a surplus of 4.65 billion dlrs in 1986 from an 890 mln dlr deficit in 1985 was very significant. The surplus enabled the country to reduce its foreign debt last year for the first time. South Korea's foreign debt, which fell to 44.5 billion dlrs in 1986 from 46.8 billion in 1985, is still among the largest in Asia. ""This huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of the major constraints on our development... Last year was a major turning point for the Korean economy,"" Kim said. Kim said his government plannned to reduce the ratio of foreign debt to the country's GNP to about 20 pct in 1991, from about 50 pct in 1986. ""The government, however, does not want to accelerate reducing the debt by making an excessive trade surplus,"" he said. Kim said a sudden rise in the surplus would cause inflation and lead to trade friction with Seoul's major trading partners, particularly the United States. ""We need a surplus because we have to reduce our debt, but we are taking measures to hold the size of the surplus at a proper level,"" Kim said."
finns and canadians to study mtbe production plant,gas lead,"Finland's national oil company Neste Oy <NEOY.HE> said in a statement it had agreed with Canadian firms to study the feasibility of building a plant in Edmonton, Canada, to produce a replacement for lead in petrol. The prospective plant would cost an estimated 270 mln Canadian dlrs and would produce methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) from raw materials available locally, it said. The partners in the study are Neste Oy, Celanese Canada Inc, Hoechst Celanese Corporation and Trade Mountain Pipe Line Company Ltd, of Vancouver, B.C. The Edmonton site was suitable because of the raw materials availability, the proximity to pipeline transportation and the important capital and operating advantages gained by locating on an existing Celanese Canada site, the statement said. The partners would look into the feasibility of a plant producing 500,000 tonnes per annum of MTBE, an octane enhancer that can replace tetra ethyl lead. Most of the MTBE would be targeted for the United States where lead levels in gasoline are being lowered because of health concerns, the statement added. Canadian lead limits are currently 11 times as high as the U.S. Limit but lead is scheduled for virtual elimination in Canada by 1993, which should create a Canadian demand for MTBE, it said. Finland's Neste Oy, whose turnover last year was over five billion dlrs, has extensive experience with MTBE. It has a major investment in an MTBE plant in Saudi Arabia. The Edmonton, Alberta plant would be scheduled to go on stream in late 1989, the statement said."
economic spotlight - australian markets booming,interest money-fx,"Australian markets are booming as foreign fund managers redirect capital away from the United States and other traditional markets, analysts said. High short-term interest rates, a bullish stock market and an increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow of fresh funds in the last two months, largely from Japanese and U.S. Investors, analysts polled by Reuters said. Fund managers want quality markets to park their cash in and have settled on Australia, Britain and Canada as they diversify from volatile U.S. Dollar instruments, they said. A one percentage point fall in key 10-year bonds rates in the past month, record share prices and a 10-month high for the currency of 0.71 U.S. Dlrs all illustrated the inflow. Official figures on the latest inflow of investment capital are not available, but brokers said they received almost daily inquiries from Japan and the United States. ""These people have got trillions of dollars sloshing about and they don't know what to do with it. Some of that is ending up here with the attraction of high interest rates and reasonable currency stability,"" National Australia Bank Ltd economist Brian Hamley said. ""There is a 'flight to quality',"" Hamley said. ""Australia may not be in the best (economic) position, but there aren't too many other countries where you'd want to put your money."" The stronger Australian dollar was also attracting investors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against the volatility of the U.S. Unit, analysts said. ""We're looking a more favoured market than perhaps the U.S. Where some people would be concerned about the value of the U.S. Dollar,"" Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose said. ""Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheap and the currency looks stable?"" But turning that capital into more permanent productive investment depends on government economic policy, he said. ""It will only disappear if people lose confidence in the direction in the economy,"" Buttrose said, adding that offshore investors would carefully watch the government's promised tough economic statement on May 14. While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding interest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just as easily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese, who were badly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollar and hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said. ""It will remain very edgy money. If something was not to be delivered, if the statement wasn't considered tough enough, one might see a substantial outflow,"" Buttrose said. Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tough economic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and stubborn current account deficit, analysts said. ""They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I think they would like to leave the money here,"" Buttrose said. Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increased interest in investment in Australia and the need to shield Japanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations. Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged an element of targeting the rate against the yen in currency policy when he said authorities could not take their ""eyes off the yen"" because of the crucial role of Japanese investors. Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had worked successfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollar within the range of 100 to 103 yen. Apart from its recovery against a weak U.S. Dollar, the Australian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a trade-weighted basis in the last three weeks. Offshore buying has also played a role in the booming Australian share market. It has followed Wall Street and other markets, but is also setting its own trend in response to the weight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into equities, particularly in the gold sector. The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3 today, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, while the gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in the same period. The property sector is also sought after, with Japanese companies that have invested heavily in the United States in recent years turning their attention to undervalued real estate, particularly in the tourism field. Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydney's five-star Regent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrs as indicative of the type of property being sought. ""They think they find good value real estate here which, with long term and fixed capital investment, is the kind of investment Australia needs,"" Buttrose added."
economic spotlight - kuwaiti economy,gnp cpi,"Kuwait's oil-reliant and debt-ridden economy has started to pull out of a nosedive but oil prices will determine the pace of recovery, bankers and economists say. Crucial will be the ability of the 13-member OPEC to hold oil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in the northern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens. Bankers estimate the economy, measured in terms of gross domestic product (gdp), shrank 19 pct in real terms last year after contracting 8.1 pct the year before. This was after taking into account inflation in consumer prices of 1.5 pct in 1985, slowing to 1.0 pct in 1986. Factors depressing economic activity include the 6-1/2-year-old Iran-Iraq war on Kuwait's doorstep, which threatens the emirate's vital oil export lifeline through the Gulf and has sapped business confidence. But sentiment received a much-needed boost in September when, after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisis caused by the 1982 crash of local stock market, a comprehensive new debt settlement program was introduced. The share crash, result of a speculative spree in forward trading, left 95 billion dlrs of post-dated cheques in default. The cheques were also used as collateral for consumer spending, thus generating an informal credit system. Much of the debt has been watered down but big sums are still owed by individuals and companies. There was some 4.4 billion dinars (about 15.7 billion dlrs) in outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986, of which one-quarter to one-third was estimated by bankers to rank as bad or doubtful debt. But the government has repeatedly said it will not allow any banks to go under. The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling of problem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whether debtors have regular cash flows or not. Banks' shareholders and depositors will have their rights guaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significance in a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sector is the biggest after oil. Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to ride out the oil glut, bankers and economists say. Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd) compared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned last year by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah. But strategic diversification into downstream operations in Europe several years ago and a hefty refining investment at home gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sell over one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products. Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average 2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processed product such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than as crude. Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reason for cautious optimism. Other reasons are low domestic inflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recent years and signs government spending on productive sectors will remain steady. External accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8 billion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct below that for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hit Gulf. Kuwait's petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were put officially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment income of the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year. But for the first time since the end of the oil boom, these reserves may not be enough to prevent a ""real"" budget deficit for the 1986/87 fiscal year ending June 30, bankers say. In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary, revenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct, doubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars. This left out income from state reserves, usually excluded in official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers at up to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in some shortfall. Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast for economic growth this year or next. ""It depends on oil prices,"" one said. ""This summer is important."" Cabinet Affairs Minister Rashid al-Rashid said last Sunday the cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise state spending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate the economy. He gave no details but bankers say these are expected to be spelled out in the 1987/88 budget, possibly in June."
malaysia may not meet 1987 oil palm target,veg-oil palm-oil soy-oil oilseed soybean,"Malaysia is unlikely to meet its targeted output of five mln tonnes of oil palm in calendar 1987, oil palm growers told Reuters. Output in 1987 is expected to reach around 4.5 mln tonnes, unchanged from 1986, because of drought, low use of fertiliser and overstressed palms, they said. The growers were asked for their reaction to an Oil World newsletter report that Malaysia's oil palm output is likely to drop sharply this year. Palm oil now sells at around 700 ringgit a tonne, or about 115 ringgit less than soybean oil, but Malaysia must sell more palm oil to prevent a stock buildup that could damage the industry, a leading grower told Reuters. The country's palm oil stocks now total some 500,000 tonnes against about 800,000 last March, the growers said. The growers expect palm oil prices to ease later this year due to pressure from South American and U.S. Soybean output. The current South American oilseed harvest, mainly soybean, is likely to be around 25.7 mln tonnes against the previous 21.7 mln tonne crop, they said. In addition, new U.S. Soybean plantings are also expected to enter the market around November when Malaysian palm oil output peaks. They said new planting of palms is also likely to slow, with some 50,000 hectares expected to be planted with new trees against 100,000 in 1986, although the effects of this reduction will not be felt for about another three years."

He said the United States could face a vicious circle of depreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took that route. Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet U.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy, accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and tolerating above-target money supply growth. He said he would have been happy to have brought forward five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to the beginning of this year, but he said the government faced political constraints getting such measures through the upper house of the West German parliament. But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could accept on exports from a rising mark, he said. Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about one-third of its gross national product, so a substantial erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing demand at home. ""A further appreciation of the mark could even be an obstacle to further growth,"" he said. Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and because external factors, including low oil prices and favourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway. But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma over monetary policy. The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not the reported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germany was affected more than before by exchange rate developments. ""For the time being, we will have to focus our policy more on the external side, and we can live with a more expansionary money supply. But we must be very careful,"" he said. He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan's trade surpluses, which affected European countries as well as the United States. Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary officials of major industrialized countries, saying the importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange rates had been underestimated. All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the right level, and that further changes would damage growth, he said. ""This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on the part of our American colleagues,"" he said. But he said there was still a danger that the correction of the dollar's value could overshoot."
u.k. money market given further 166 mln stg help,money-fx interest,"The Bank of England said it provided the market with further help totalling 166 mln stg during the afternoon. In band one, it bought 31 mln stg of treasury bills and three mln stg of bank bills at 9-7/8 pct, while in band two it bought 69 mln stg of bank bills at 9-13/16 pct. In addition, it bought 63 mln stg of band three bank bills at 9-3/4 pct. This brings the total assistance by the Bank so far today to 219 mln stg against a liquidity shortage it has estimated at around 300 mln stg."
zambia does not plan retail maize price hike,grain corn,"The Zambian government has no immediate plans to follow last week's increase in the producer price of maize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, an official of the ruling party said. Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for refined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots in which at least 15 people died. That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda later revoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reduce the government's subsidy bill. However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67 dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail price increase, the government will have to spend more on subsidies, a practice discouraged by the IMF. ""There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of meal. It (the government) would have to choose between the demands of the IMF and those of the people,"" a Ministry of Agriculture economist said."
further argentine coarse grain losses feared,grain corn sorghum sunseed wheat oilseed soybean,"Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said. They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas. However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season. Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa. There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa. Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean. However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower. Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again. The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln. Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season. Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April. Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously. This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes. Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln. Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April. The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season. The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop. The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln. The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86. The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available. Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years."
energy/u.s. petrochemical industry,pet-chem crude acq earn,"Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted. This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp <GAF>, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants. Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc <ASH>, the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy. ""I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period,"" said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co <DOW>, adding, ""There's no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones."" Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year. U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said. Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history. In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. ""I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,"" Oreffice said. GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985. The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Pace's John Dosher. Dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports. Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s. Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts. GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp <UK>, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp <BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace <GRA> has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions. But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers. ""Companies like DuPont <DD> and Monsanto Co <MTC> spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated,"" Dosher said. ""But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market."" Some top chemical executives share the concern. ""The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes,"" GAF's Heyman cautioned. ""The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long."" Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend. Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast. The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products. ""This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business,"" Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually. Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth."

brazil grain harvest faces storage problems,grain corn oilseed soybean,"Storage problems with Brazil's record grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said. Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia, told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this year's estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost. He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage problems. Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes, theoretically sufficient for the crop. But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but were responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production. The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage capacity. Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grains production but only 20 pct of its storage space. In addition to the poor distribution of storage units, there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for storing loose grain, Brito said. Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the crops. The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop has been evident from television reports, which have shown enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries."

j.p. morgan<jpm> says dlr may prevent fed easing,money-fx dlr interest,"The relatively high level of real U.S. interest rates suggests that there is scope for further declines in money market rates, but the Federal Reserve is unlikely to promote such a drop as long as the dollar remains volatile, said J.P. Morgan and Co Inc chairman Lewis Preston. He said in response to a reporter's question after the bank's annual meeting that money market rates could decline further but, ""I don't think the Fed is going to encourage that as long as the exchange markets are as volatile as they are."" On the other hand, he said that, barring a collapse of the dollar, he did not see rates going much higher. He said that Morgan's recent rise in its prime lending rate was ""purely a reflection of an increase in a whole spectrum of rates."" Preston reiterated earlier company forecasts that the U.S. economy should show roughly 2.5 to three pct real growth this year. He also said that as a consequence of the dollar's decline and oil price rises, inflation would rise ""moderately"" to a 3.5 to four pct rate in 1987."
union texas oil reserves dropped in 1986,crude earn,"Union Texas Petroleum said its worldwide proved reserves fell to 511 mln barrels of oil equivalent at the end of 1986 from 555 mln barrels reported in 1985. In its newly released annual report, Union Texas said it replaced about 71 pct of its production of 56 mln barrels of oil equivalent last year after taking into account the sale of 27 mln barrels of U.S. reserves. Union Texas, the nation's largest independent oil and gas producer based on revenues, is a privately-held company owned by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co and Allied-Signal Inc <ALD>. The Houston-based company said it lost 57.5 mln dlrs on 1.26 billion dlrs in sales last year, compared to profits of 165 mln dlrs on 2.04 billion dlrs in sales in 1985. Union Texas said it received an average of 13.35 dlrs per barrel for its international oil production and 2.99 dlrs per mcf for its foreign natural gas sales. The majority of the company's total energy production is in the United Kingdom, Indonesia and Pakistan. In the United States, Union Texas said it completed evaluation work on its oil find in Alaska's Colville Delta area. ""Although significant oil reserves were confirmed, development of this discovery will not be economical without substantially higher prices,"" the company said. Union Texas said it planned to spend about 42 mln dlrs over the next two years to develop its Eugene Island Block 371 in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1987, the company said it budgeted 178 mln dlrs for capital spending, less than half of the amount spent in 1985 and down from 199 mln dlrs budgeted last year. Union Texas also said it would seek acquisitions of oil and gas properties as well as petrochemical-related businesses."
"u.s. meat, poultry inspection called faulty",livestock carcass,"The U.S. meat and poultry inspection programs are incapable of protecting consumers from contaminated products, groups representing inspectors and consumers charged. ""The whole trend of inspection for the last 10 years has been to corrupt and to degrade the system where today the public is at constant risk to contaminated and adulterated meat,"" Kenneth Blaylock, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, told a House Agriculture subcommittee. ""The American consumer has little reason to feel confident about the safety of meat and poultry being offered to him today,"" said Rodney Leonard, executive director of the Community Nutrition Institute. ""Company management is less concerned about the risk to health than about raising plant output and company profits,"" Leonard told a hearing of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy and Poultry. Kenneth Morrison, staff associate at the Government Accountability Project, said inspectors consistently disclose violations of federal law, demonstrating a ""serious breakdown in the entire inspection system."" Morrison told of chicken fat for flavoring being contaminated by ""intestines dragging in a water trough used to flush away the condemned product, fecal material, human spit, chewing gum and paper towels used by plant employees to blow their noses."" Donald Houston, administrator of the U.S. Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service, FSIS, defended the government's program, calling it ""one of the most respected public health programs in the world."" FSIS inspects an estimated 127 mln head of cattle and 4.5 billion chicken and turkeys every year. Houston said inspection programs have kept pace with change, but conceded that the danger of chemical residues in the meat and poultry supply has increased. He also said that, although he was confident the bacterium salmonella eventually could be eradicated, it would take time and much money to contain the growing problem. Salmonella, which in extreme cases can cause death, is found in approximately 37 pct of U.S. broilers, 12 pct of raw pork and three to five pct of raw beef, Houston said. The number of reported cases has doubled over the past 20 years, he said, to 40,000 cases annually. ""We certainly really have not found an effective means of turning this disease around,"" said Rep. James Olin (D-Va.) The National Research Council recommended in 1985 that FSIS intensify efforts to develop rapid diagnostic procedures for detecting microoganisms. But the meat and poultry industries have said such controls would cost too much. ""Hopefully we will not overreact by installing unnecessarily complicated procedures that may become obstacles to the real goal of providing an increasingly safer, more nutritious and economical meat supply for consumers,"" Stanley Emerling, executive vice president of the National Association of Meat Purveyors, said. Blaylock, speaking on behalf of food inspectors, said a new program allowing elimination of USDA inspection functions at certain plants ""voids the law in letter and spirit, and must be repealed or we will see rising consumer fraud and an epidemic of death and illness for which there will be no prevention nor legal recourse."" Subcommittee Chairman Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) said the panel would hold a hearing on salmonella June 2."

south korea corn imports may increase - usda,grain corn,"South Korea's purchase of about 2.4 mln tonnes of U.S. corn in the past six months -- close to double last year's total -- indicates that imports from the United States, as well as total imports are set for a dramatic jump, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. In its World Production and Trade Report, the department said total South Korea corn imports for the 1986/87 season (Oct-Sept) are estimated at 4.3 mln tonnes, with about 3.4 mln tonnes from the United States. During the 1985/86 season, imports totaled only 1.3 mln tonnes of U.S. corn out of a total of 3.6 mln tonnes. Ite appears the Koreans are shifting back to U.S. corn in light of competitive U.S. prices and uncertain supplies from China, Argentina and South Africa, it said."

In its World Production and Trade Report, the department said the branding is necessary to improve surveillance for bovine tuberculosis because it provides a permanent way to identify Mexican steers. The requirement is not expected to affect the number of Mexican steers imported into the United States and the brand will be applied before the animals arrive at U.S. ports of entry. Last November, the Mexican Government authorized an export quota of nearly 1.1 mln head of live cattle for the 1986/87 season (Aug-July), most of which goes to the United States."
"canada to monitor steel imports, exports",trade iron-steel,"Canada plans to monitor steel shipments flowing in and out of the country in an attempt to appease concerns in the U.S. over the high level of Canadian steel exports, Trade Minister Pat Carney said. ""To help maintain our open access to the U.S. steel market, the government is taking further action to ensure we have more accurate data on exports and imports and that Canada is not used as a backdoor to the U.S. market by offshore suppliers,"" Carney said. Carney also said Canadian companies were being asked to exercise prudence in the U.S. market and both countries were considering establishing a joint commission to study the growing steel problem. Carney told the House of Commons she will soon announce an amendment to the Exports and Imports Permits Act to set up the monitoring program. Canadian steel shipments to the U.S. have risen to 5.7 pct cent of the U.S. market in recent months, almost double the level just two years ago, Canadian trade officials said. The increase in Canadian shipments comes at a time of growing anger in the U.S. over rising steel imports from several countries in the face of a decline in the domestic steel industry. Some U.S. lawmakers have proposed Canada's share of the American market be limited to 2.4 pct."
u.s.senate lifts some bans on natural gas,nat-gas crude,"The Senate unanimously approved legislation to lift a ban on new construction of natural gas-fired power plants and other large industrial gas-burning plants. The bill, sponsored by Senate Energy Committee chairman Bennett Johnston, also repeals mandatory incremental pricing of natural gas which was designed to protect residential consumers from major price increases by forcing some industrial users to pay higher than market prices. ""This legislation will open up new natural gas markets,"" the Lousiana Democrat said. The gas restrictions were enacted in 1978 in response to a shortage of natural gas and predictions of higher prices. ""Now both oil and gas prices are severely depressed,"" Johnston said. In a compromise with coal producers, the bill requires new baseload electric powerplants be designed to accomodate modifications necessary to burning coal or another alternate fuel."

In its weekly petroleum status report, the Energy Department agency said distillate demand was off 7.9 pct in the period to 2.90 mln bpd from 3.15 mln a year earlier. Gasoline demand averaged 6.76 mln bpd, off 3.1 pct from 6.98 mln last year, while residual fuel demand was 1.15 mln bpd, off 16.9 pct from 1.39 mln, the EIA said. So far this year, distillate demand fell 2.3 pct to 3.20 mln bpd from 3.28 mln in 1986, gasoline demand was 6.63 mln bpd, off 0.3 pct from 6.65 mln, and residual fuel demand fell 4.9 pct to 1.35 mln bpd from 1.42 mln, the EIA said. Year-to-date domestic crude output was estimated at 8.40 mln bpd, off 7.6 pct from 9.09 mln a year ago, while gross crude imports averaged 3.92 mln bpd, up 27.1 pct from 3.08 mln, it said."
bundesbank calls for central bank cooperation,interest money-fx,"Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler called on central banks of major industrialised nations to cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies. In a lecture at the University of Surrey, pre-released here, Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was protectionism and control on capital movements. ""Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have them,"" he said. He added that West German growth forecasts would have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop to 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987. Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets had parted company with transactions in goods, services and investments. It was the scale of speculative transactions that determined market trends. Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to grow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rates would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off. ""In other words, the monetary policy measures required are different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to -- those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of mounting economic activity,"" Koehler said. The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S. Current account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciation going by talking the dollar down posed problems. The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep rise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the cost of European imports. But the volume effect of falling imports to the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time to make itself felt compared with the price effect. ""Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going further than would be necessary to adjust the current account over the medium term,"" Koehler said. A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occur only if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand. In Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand should rise faster than GNP. ""In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986,"" Koehler said. If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be prevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset by an inflow of foreign funds into the U.S.. But only if there was an appropriate interest rate differential would Europe and Japan look for financial investment in the U.S. When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bank had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions. Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market and its substantial impact on exchange rates. It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of price stability, economic growth and full employment but also to tackle international problems like the exchange rate problem, the debt problem and the current account problem. A strategy had to be designed that helped ""the safeguarding of non-inflationary economic growth in an international monetary system largely free of disruptions,"" Koehler said. Given the system of floating exchange rates, it was necessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficed to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over the next few years and intervention points should not be set, because they were only testing points for the market, he said. In order to keep the international monetary system free of disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but also cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said."

""We have no idea about the report and cannot comment,"" a spokesman told Reuters. Nihon Keizai Shinbun, quoting unnamed government sources, said Japan would tell U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter of its intentions. The two are due to visit Japan later this month for farm talks. The U.S. Has been pressing Japan to discuss the rice issue at the new round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks. But Japan has said GATT is not the right forum. Imports of rice to Japan are banned under the Foodstuff Control Act. Nihon Keizai said Japan's plan resulted from worries about mounting trade tension with the U.S. At the GATT talks, Japan will try to persuade the U.S. That its rice policy is justified, it said. The 93-nation world trade body began the Uruguay trade round last September. It will take four years to negotiate."
economic spotlight - telecom is key japan ministry,acq trade,"Japan's little-known Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) has emerged as an international force to be reckoned with, political analysts said. MPT, thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the U.S. And Britain, is in a position of strength due to its control of a lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians, they said. ""The ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control of a key industrial sector, telecommunications and information,"" said one diplomatic source. ""They are a potent political force,"" the diplomatic source said. But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does not always help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy, analysts said. ""The ministry was a minor ministry and its people were not so internationalized,"" said Waseda University professor Mitsuru Uchida. ""Suddenly they're standing at the centre of the world community and in that sense, they're at a loss (as to) how to face the situation."" Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row with London over efforts by Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc to keep a major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete in Japan's lucrative overseas telephone business. The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rival groups, arguing the market cannot support more than one competitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which now monopolizes the business. It has also opposed a major management role in the planned merger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm on the grounds that no such international precedent exists. The ministry's stance has outraged both London, which has threatened to retaliate, and Washington, which says the merger plan is evidence of Japan's failure to honour pledges to open its telecommunications market. Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which it says have limited access for U.S. Firms to Japan's car telephone and satellite communications market. Much of MPT's new prominence stems from the growth of the sector it regulates. ""What has been happening is an important shift in the economy which makes the ministry a very important place,"" said James Abegglen, head of the consulting firm Asia Advisory Service Inc. A decision to open the telecommunications industry to competition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boosted rather than lessened MPT's authority, analysts said. ""With the legal framework eased, they became the de facto legal framework,"" said Bache Securities (Japan) analyst Darrell Whitten. Close links with the powerful political faction of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) nurtured by former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka are another key to MPT's influence, the analysts said. ""Other factions ignored MPT (in the 1970s), but the Tanaka faction was forward looking and ... Recognized the importance of MPT,"" Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members of the influential political group, he added. The ministry also has power in the financial sector due to the more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in the Postal Savings System, analysts said. MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulate interest rates on small deposits, a key element in financial liberalisation, since the change would remove the Postal Savings System's ability to offer slightly higher rates than banks, they said. Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT's obstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterized the ministry as feudal. Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limiting competition and sheltering the former monopolies under its wing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowest price takes a back seat to such considerations, they said. But many of the ministry's actions are not unlike those of its bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western world including Britain, several analysts said. ""The United States is really the odd man out,"" Abegglen said. ""For a government to take the view that it wants to keep order in utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonable view,"" he said."
g-7 issues statement after meeting,trade money-fx,"Following is the text of a statement by the Group of Seven -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- issued after a Washington meeting yesterday. 1. The finance ministers and central bank governors of seven major industrial countries met today. They continued the process of multilateral surveillance of their economies pursuant to the arrangements for strengthened economic policy coordination agreed at the 1986 Tokyo summit of their heads of state or government. The managing director of the International Monetary Fund also participated in the meeting. 2. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting, and noted the progress achieved in implementing the undertakings embodied in the Louvre Agreement. They agreed, however, that further actions will be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain global economic expansion, and reduce trade imbalances. In this connection they welcomed the proposals just announced by the governing Liberal Democratic Party in Japan for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate Japan's economy through early implementation of a large supplementary budget exceeding those of previous years, as well as unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures. The government of Japan reaffirmed its intention to further open up its domestic markets to foreign goods and services. 3. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that around current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting. In that connection they welcomed the strong implementation of the Louvre Agreement. They concluded that present and prospective progress in implementing the policy undertakings at the Louvre and in this statement provided a basis for continuing close cooperation to foster the stability of exchange rates."

"bank of japan buys dollars in tokyo, dealers say",dlr money-fx,"The Bank of Japan bought a modest amount of dollars at around 145.10 yen just after the market here opened, dealers said. Just before the opening, the dollar dropped swiftly as speculators concluded the Group of Seven (G-7) comminuique issued in Washington contained nothing basically new, they said. It fell about a half yen, to around 145. The G-7 reaffirmed that their currencies around current levels reflect economic fundamentals. One dealer said the Bank of Japan probably intervened in Australia before the opening here, but could not confirm this."

european markets react quietly to g-7 communique,dlr money-fx,"European currency markets reacted quietly to the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to surprise that the markets should have expected so much. The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it. Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining broadly entrenched in its current trading range. ""The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84 marks,"" said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank AG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs. However, she said the dollar could break out of the range with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S. Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday. Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen, possibly to 140 yen. A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term. London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank operators to test the downside. Concern that finance ministers and officials still in Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the near term, the traders said. Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's downward trend. Traders in several centres said the market would look for fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to defend current ranges, which the communique said were ""broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."" Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said ""They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon."" The U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said. However, some dealers said London-based operators would be unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long Easter weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825 marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen. Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said the G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme volatility seen in the first few months of this year. One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the communique made clear the leading nations did not want a further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar. The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to 1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre accord's supposed currency target range. A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were ready for a period of ""mainly sideways movement."" But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique contributing to greater stability. ""Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big boost,"" said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks in the next three months. A Swiss monetary source, who asked not to be named, said the communique had been in line with realistic expectations and should not have produced disappointment. ""The problem is that the changes needed in fiscal and trade policies to redress current imbalances are of a different timescale than currency markets operate on,"" the source told Reuters, ""This is a political process which takes time."" Alois Schwietert, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corp in Basle, also questioned the tone of disappointment evident on currency markets today. ""Did people really expect a patent remedy?"" he asked. Bank economists in Paris noted yesterday's meeting was only the first in a series and said the market would watch carefully in the next few weeks for any changes in positions. A senior economist with Banque Indosuez said the focus was now on trade and growth rather than interest rates. Any move by Japan and West Germany to boost their economic growth could lead to a quick change in the U.S. Position. Dealers in all centres agreed that markets would be wary in pushing the dollar too far too quickly in the coming months while central banks appear resolved to use their muscle to support the Paris accord."
german money market split on lower rate prospects,money-fx interest,"Remarks by central bankers raised some hopes the Bundesbank will cut rates on securities repurchase pacts, but operators remained divided on the likelihood of a move in the near term, money market dealers said. Comments by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler yesterday that rate cuts were needed to curb money supply growth from speculative capital inflows, and by West Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss that there was no natural lower limit to the discount rate had, however, no immediate impact. Call money declined to 3.65/75 pct from 3.75/85 pct but the drop was tied to extra liquidity in the market, dealers said. Dealers said the Bundesbank's latest liquidity allotment this week dashed some hopes of lower rates. The Bundesbank allotted only 6.1 billion marks yesterday in new liquidity in a repurchase pact at an unchanged rate of 3.80 pct, thus subtracting some 8.8 billion marks from the market, as an outgoing 14.9 billion pact expired. But some dealers said the smaller volume awarded by the pact was in line with present liquid money market conditions, and did not exlude a cut in the repurchase pact rate soon to 3.70 pct if money market rates continue at present levels. The next opportunity for the Bundesbank to lower rates on repurchase pacts will be in a tender expected next Tuesday. Bundesbank officials have already said they favour more discreet rate adjustments through repurchase pacts, rather than the more public adjustment of leading rates. The Bundesbank may either set a fixed allocation rate and allow banks to tender for the volume, as has been the case since it lowered its discount rate January 22, or else it may allow banks to tender for the rate and set the volume itself. Dealers expect volume of the tender to be lower than the 15.2 billion marks flowing out, to offset other incoming funds. Some seven billion marks is expected to flow in next week. This should then flow back into the market as it is deposited with banks. Banks were well supplied with liquidity, holding 61.5 billion marks in reserves at the Bundesbank on Tuesday. Holdings of average daily reserves over the first seven days of April stood at 59.6 billion marks, still above the estimated 51 billion required for all of April."

"fao sees lower global wheat, grain output in 1987",wheat grain,"The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said global wheat and coarse grain output was likely to fall in 1987 but supplies would remain adequate to meet demand. FAO said in its monthly food outlook bulletin total world grain output was expected to fall 38 mln tonnes to 1,353 mln in 1987, due mainly to unusually high winter losses in the Soviet Union, drought in China and reduced plantings in North America. World cereal stocks at the end of 1986/87 were forecast to rise 47 mln tonnes to a record 452 mln tonnes, softening the impact of reduced production. But stocks are unevenly distributed, with about 50 pct held by the U.S. ""Thus the food security prospects in 1987/88 for many developing countries, particularly in Africa, depend crucially on the outcome of this year's harvests,"" FAO said. FAO said world cereal supplies in 1986/87 were estimated at a record 2,113 mln tonnes, about five pct higher than last season and due mainly to large stocks and a record 1986 harvest, estimated at 1,865 mln tonnes. FAO's forecast of 1986/87 world cereals trade was revised upwards by eight mln tonnes to 179 mln due to the likelihood of substantial buying by China and the Soviet Union."

bundesbank sees no change in monetary course,money-fx interest,"The Bundesbank sees no current reason to change monetary course, vice-president Helmut Schlesinger told Reuters in a telephone interview. Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks yesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and West Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which, dealers said, revived some speculation that German interest rate cuts may once again be under discussion. Schlesinger said he had no comment on the remarks of his two central bank council colleagues. But he added that the last central bank council meeting on April 2 had discussed the economic situation with a mood of ""subdued optimism,"" particularly influenced by the news brought by several state central bank presidents. ""Much is going better than the impression gained by the public from the January figures, which have been in the meantime superseded,"" he said. German January industrial output fell 3.0 pct after a decline of 0.9 pct in December. New industry orders fell 1.9 pct after they had been unchanged in December. Bank economists said that the two together showed the economy would either stagnate or contract in the first quarter of 1987. Aside from the economic developments, Schlesinger added, a steady monetary course was important to hold the dollar/mark rate around current levels as Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl had said while attending the Washington World Bank/IMF meeting. Asked, however, if the Bundesbank could move to cut rates on repurchase agreements at the setting of the next repurchase tender, due next Tuesday, Schlesinger said, ""Since the central bank council gives its opinion on this theme only every 14 days, this is hardly probable."" Responding to the question whether the Bundesbank had moved away from a policy of targetting monetary growth toward one of targetting currency rates, Schlesinger said he could have no comment on the subject while negotiations were still in progress in Washington."
u.s. said to view g-7 meeting as major success,dlr yen,"The United States, which has long sought Japanese action to stimulate its economy, appears to be satisfied Tokyo's latest package is a major development and allows leading industrial nations to reaffirm their agreement to stabilize currencies. Monetary sources said they believed that U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker considered Tokyo's package, announced yesterday, to be a major stimulation of the Japanese economy. But yesterday's statement by seven leading industrial powers endorses the yen's rise from around 153 to the dollar, the level at the February 22 Paris Accord, to about 145 today. And the initial reaction of currency markets in the Far East demonstrates that financial markets are unconvinced that currencies yet reflect economic fundamentals, even though the countries appear to do so. The yen sank below 145 at one point despite intervention by the Bank of Japan. Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's Finance Minister, said the movement since Paris was consistent with currency trading ranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks. ""I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the past several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the discussions in Paris,"" Miyazawa said yesterday. The supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs was announced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve of Miyazawa's departure for Washington, to attend yesterday's meetings of leading industrial nations. In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action ""extraordinary and urgent"", the meeting reaffirmed the Paris Accord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals, or economic reality. The Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- therefore repeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to foster exchange rate stability. The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central bank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt the dollar's fall. While relatively unsuccessful, the scale of intervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent years. Monetary sources also said they understood that Secretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremely successful in the light of the Japanese announcement. They also said there was a growing feeling among the finance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over medium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-term differences in past meetings. West Germany, whose currency has not risen anything like the yen since the Paris Agreement, appears from the face of yesterday's statement to have won acceptance from other countries that its exchange rate is acceptable. Bonn's finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues that major currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance between West Germany and Japan's trade surpluses and America's trade deficit have already taken place. No mention was made, however, of the U.S. commitment to cut the budget deficit even though it is implied in the reafffirmation of Paris. European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts are essential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall that reached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year. A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier this week by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A further sharp fall to redress trade imbalances would ""clearly pose substantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could undermine confidence in future financial stability,"" he said. Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the politically independent Fed to drive up interest rates. Monetary sources said that, privately, West Germany welcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own currency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit. Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weak dollar blunts Tokyo's export drive to the United States, the Japanese monolith will concentrate on European markets. The ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on making their policy coordination more binding and one, Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson, said good progress was made. Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summit to prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations. The United States and France, backed by the International Monetary Fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or ""norms"" for a limited number of economic objectives such as growth, inflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and current account balances. Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in consultations between the countries on whether corrective action should be required. But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives has Bonn and London worried, monetary sources say, because it implies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones. The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfully sounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit currency fluctuations just before the February meeting. The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges of the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from the relatively free currency markets of recent years."
spanish employers worried by high interest rates,interest money-supply trade,"The head of Spain's employers' federation, Jose Maria Cuevas, said employers were worried about the government's monetary policies because high real interest rates were hampering investment. He told a news conference wage pacts signed so far this year were not endangering the government's five pct inflation target. The government's perceived need to control inflation by keeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said. High real interest rates were attracting an influx of speculative foreign capital which was undercutting the government's target for monetary growth, Cuevas said. Spain's most closely-watched measure of money supply, liquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17 pct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and a target range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987. To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call money rate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from 11.8 at end-1986. Cuevas said employers were heeding the government's call to hold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year, with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and new wage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987. These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanish workers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations. He said Spain's current wave of strikes mainly affected the state sector, where the government is trying to impose its five pct wage ceiling. Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend in Spain's foreign trade balance.

india foodgrain target 160 mln tonnes in 1987/88,grain rice wheat sorghum,"India's national foodgrain target has been fixed at 160 mln tonnes in 1987/88 (Apr-Mar), unchanged from the 1986/87 target, the Agriculture Ministry said in its annual report for 1986/87. Actual output was estimated at 151 mln tonnes in 1986/87 due to failure of monsoon rains in 15 out of 35 meterological sub-divisions of the country. The report gave the targets for various crops with estimated harvested crops in 1986/87 in brackets as following, in mln tonnes - rice 65 (60), wheat 49 (49), coarse grains including sorghum and millets 32 (29) and pulses 14 (13). Despite failure of monsoon rains in recent years, it was possible to maintain higher foodgrain production, signifying growing resilience in agricultural sector, the report said. The strategy for increasing irrigation potential along with greater use of high yielding seed varieites and improvement in fertiliser efficiency is yielding results, it said, adding total foodgrain output in 1985/86, 1984/85 and 1983/84 respectively was 150.5 mln tonnes, 145.5 mln and a record 152.4 mln. India has targeted to produce between 178 and 183 mln tonnes of foodgrains by the last year of the seventh five-year development plan ending March 31, 1990. Taking the midpoint of 180 mln tonnes as the target and the 1986/87 estimated production of around 151 mln tonnes, the gap of 29 mln tonnes has to be made up during the remaining three years of the plan by increasing grain output annually by more than nine mln tonnes. But the target can be achieved only with good weather, the report said. ""The major thrust programme will, therefore, be better water (irrigation) management. Simultaneously, efforts for spread of improved technology including timely use of inputs (farm materials like fertilisers) in adequate quantities have to be vigrously pursued,"" it said."

But the forecast for 1986/87 is well below a target of 14.8 mln tonnes fixed for the year, it said, adding bad weather hit groundnut and other oilseed crops. The National Oilseeds Development Program will invest 300 mln rupees in 1986/87 on supplying improved high-yielding seeds and other support services to help boost production, it added.

dollar ends lower in lacklustre frankfurt,dlr money-fx,"The dollar drifted down to end one pfennig lower after a lacklustre session, held in limits by the lack of concrete news from the Group of Seven meeting and comments on the edge of the Washington IMF/World Bank meeting. Dealers said the communique early in the European morning from the G-7 meeting contained no significant new factors and although the dollar dipped it generally resisted further attempts to push it lower through the day. The U.S. Currency ended at 1.8270/80 marks, below yesterday's last 1.8365/75. Koch said the assessment of the dollar's direction was based on a global view, with operators paying most attention to comments by finance officials to see how closely they stated adherence to international agreements such as those set at the Plaza Hotel in 1985 and in Paris on February 22. Koch described the wording of the communique from the G-7 as ""soft as wax."" Bundebank vice-president Helmut Schlesinger told Reuters in a telephone interview that the German central bank sees no current reason to change monetary course at present. Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks yesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and West Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which dealers said revived some speculation that German interest rate cuts may be under consideration. German call money was slightly softer today, at around 3.70 pct after 3.80 yesterday. Some dealers said rates on new liquidity injections added via Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements may be cut next week. Hopes of a cut were dashed on Tuesday with an allocation at an unchanged 3.80 pct. But speaking of the pact tender rate next week, Schlesinger said, ""since the central bank council gives its opinion on this theme only every 14 days, this is hardly probable."" Euromark rates scarcely responded to the central bankers comments, with six months funds ending unaltered at around 3-7/8 pct. Eurodollars for the same maturity rose a fractional 1/16 pct from yesterday to around 6-11/16 pct. Sterling dipped to end at 2.952/956 marks after 2.960/965 last night.

brazil soybean yields seen average - usda report,oilseed soybean grain corn wheat,"Based on field travel in the Brazilian state of Parana, soybean yields should be about average or 2.0 to 2.2 tonnes per hectare, the U.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Sao Paulo said in a field report. The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about 20 to 24 pct of Brazil's total soybean crop. It said generally favorable weather from early December through February helped compensate for earlier dryness. However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 days followed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the second week of march has raised concern about late planted soybeans which are still immature, but the impact may be localized, the report said. The corn crop is expected to be a record and will create serious storage problems, the report said. Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased by more than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields are expected to be above average, it said. Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn crop crop has been harvested. During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grain elevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn, the report said. New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline -- Parana accounts for about 60 pct of total production. Major reasons for the decline are expected reduced government support price and good summer crop harvests."

The agreement guarantees access to the Spanish market for two mln tonnes of non-EC maize a year for the next four years. The sources said the intervention price for the maize would be 201.49 Ecus a tonne. They said at this price it seemed unlikely that the full They added the decision is also designed to prevent massive offers of maize for intervention just ahead of the normal April 30 deadline, which could be caused by speculation about the implementation of the accord with the United States."

disease puts zimbabwe beef exports in jeopardy,livestock carcass,"Zimbabwe's beef exports to the European Community (EC), potentially worth 70 mln Zimbabwean dlrs this year, may be jeopardised by an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in southwestern Matabeleland, industry sources said. The country has temporarily suspended beef exports to the EC because of the outbreak and awaits a decision from the EC veterinary committee, which is considering a formal ban. The outbreak in the country's main ranching province has already led neighbouring beef-producing Botswana and Zambia to bar beef and dairy imports from Zimbabwe, threatening the dairy industry with a loss of at least one mln dlrs in export revenue. ""The situation is still uncertain at the moment. Normally when an outbreak occurs there is an automatic suspension of beef exports,"" one industry source said yesterday. Commenting on EC policy, he explained, ""Depending on the seriousness of the outbreak the (veterinary) committee then decides on three options, allowing us to continue exporting beef from disease-free areas, clamping a three-month suspension on exports or banning us from exporting for a year. We are still awaiting their decision,"" he added, asking not to be identified. Zimbabwe was granted an export quota of 8,100 tonnes of high-grade beef to EC markets in 1985 after the country had spent millions of dollars erecting disease-control fences and upgrading abattoirs to meet stringent EC rules. Should the EC ban Zimbabwean exports, the country will be forced to sell its beef on glutted world beef markets at low prices, the source said. Projected earnings from beef sales could fall about 23 mln dlrs as a result, he said."

soviet union to import more grain in 86/87-usda,grain wheat,"The U.S. Agriculture Department increased its estimate of 1986/87 grain purchases by the Soviet Union to 28 mln tonnes, up two mln tonnes from last month. In its monthly report on the Soviet grain situation, the USDA said imports will be higher than earlier estimated because Soviet grain buyers have been actively purchasing in the last month. USDA said the increased purchasing is ""somewhat surprising"" because of recent higher Soviet crop estimates. All of the increase in estimated imports will be in corn, USDA said. Of the 28 mln tonnes total, 15 mln tonnes will be wheat, 12 mln tonnes coarse grains, and the remaining one mln tonnes miscellaneous grains and pulses, USDA said. USDA noted that the Soviet winter grain crop suffered through a severe winter and spring field work has been delayed. The severe winter ""is believed to have resulted in above average winter-kill,"" USDA said. Some grain trade analysts have said abnormal winter losses maybe one reason why the Soviet Union has been actively buying grain recently. USDA said Moscow already has purchased over 25 mln tonnes grain for delivery in 1986/87, including 14 mln tonnes wheat and 12 mln tonnes coarse grain."

usda comments on export sales report,grain oilseed meal-feed veg-oil,"U.S. corn sales of just over 1.0 mln tonnes in the week ended April 2 were eight pct above the prior week, but 25 pct below the four-week average, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. In comments on its latest Export Sales Report, the department said Iraq, Japan and the USSR were the largest buyers. Sales for the next marketing year, which begins September 1, totaled 503,200 tonnes and were mainly to Iraq and Taiwan. Wheat sales of 119,300 tonnes for the current season and net reductions of 13,700 tonnes for the 1987/88 season were four-fifths below the combined total for the prior week and the four-week average, it said. Sri Lanka was the most active wheat destination with purchases of 52,500 tonnes for the current year, it said. Other significant purchasers for the current year were Mexico and Honduras, it said. Soybean sales of 240,500 tonnes were one-fifth below the prior week and nearly one-third below the four-week average. Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Italy and Israel were the major purchasers, the department said. Net sales of 117,700 tonnes of soybean cake and meal fell 31 pct from the previous week and 38 pct below the four-week average. Major increases for West Germany, Venezuela, the Netherlands and Saudi Arabia were partially offset by reductions for unknown destinations, USDA said. Activity in soybean oil resulted in decreases of 2,400 tonnes, with sales to unknown destinations down by 2,700 tonnes, while sales to Canada increased 200 tonnes, the Department said. Combined sales of 71,300 running bales of cotton -- 60,200 bales for the current season and 11,100 bales for 1987/88 season -- were four-fifths higher than the prior week's level but nine pct below the four-week average. Mexico was the dominant buyer for the current year followed by Zaire, Italy, and Spain, the department said.

u.s. dollar losses propel broad commodity gains,money-fx grain cotton livestock gold silver,"Commodities from gold to grains to cotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as losses in the U.S. dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears of inflation and economic instability. Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in New York, where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs a troy ounce, and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce. A key factor behind the advance was anticipation that inflation will be the only way for the major industrial nations to halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, said Steve Chronowitz, director of commodity research with Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co., in New York. The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials from the seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed their commitment to support its value, and despite reports of intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, traders said. Traders said it appears that the industrial nations, known as the Group of Seven, lack the ability to change the long-term direction of the currency markets. ""Maybe they have some ideas or plans,"" said Chronowitz. ""If they do, it's not evident."" ""It looks like there's no cure but to let the free market take values to where they should be. ""One way or another, we will force our major trading partners to stimulate their economies,"" as a measure to correct the mounting U.S. trade deficit, Chronowitz said. ""I think the markets believe, and have believed for a long time, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It's going to be a long and tedious process, but that's what's happening,"" he said. The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commodities cheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand. At the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bonds saw the value of their investments falling and many are turning to commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said Marty McNeill, a metals analyst in New York with the trading house of Dominick and Dominick. The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughout the commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cotton posted broad gains. Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in the grain markets has shifted from concern about burdensome supplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulate export demand. After the close of trading, the Agriculture Department raised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union by two mln tonnes from the month-earlier report. Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle were moderately higher. Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices. They said hogs haven't been making the weight gains that are normal at this time of year, and farmers have been too busy with field work to market animals."

analysts doubt fed firmed despite borrowing rise,interest money-fx dlr,"Economists said that they doubt the Federal Reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar, despite higher discount window borrowings in the latest two-week statement period and very heavy borrowings Wednesday. Data out today show net borrowings from the Fed averaged 393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to Wednesday, up from 265 mln dlrs in the prior statement period. Wednesday borrowings were 1.4 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct. ""One could make a case that the Fed is firming, but it probably isn't,"" said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds. Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policy modestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in the two-weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averaging around 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months. However, the Dean Witter economist noted that the latest two-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demand often pushes up borrrowings. ""Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy, but it looks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisions late in the statement period and didn't quite make it,"" said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today that the Fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs or more in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday. Still, McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss in its estimates over the week that caused it to add fewer reserves earlier in the week than were actually needed. The Fed took no market reserve management action last Thursday and Friday, the first two days of the week. It added temporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves directly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday. Based on Fed data out today, economists calculated that the two-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged on Tuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs. They put Wednesday's overnight System repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs. ""It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy at this time,"" said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc. Citing the view shared by the other two economists, Leuzzi said the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest rates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak economies in the United States and abroad and add to the financial stress of developing countries and their lenders. ""Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the latest statement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar tumbled,"" said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch. He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a new statement period began today on disappointment yesterday's Washington meetings of international monetary officials failed to produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid. In fact, currency dealers said there was nothing in Wednesday's G-7 communique to alter the prevailing view that the yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade imbalance between the United States and Japan. The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming for steady policy now that should correspond to a weekly average Fed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct. This is about where the rate has been since early November. ""I'm not so sure that the Fed is engineering a tighter policy to help the dollar, as some suspect,"" said Sullivan of Dean Witter. If it is, however, he said that Fed probably has just nudged up its funds rate goal to around 6.25 to 6.35 pct from six to 6.10 pct previously."

Most dealers were surpised by the dollar's sharp fall against the yen in New York, although many had expected such a drop to happen eventually. Institutional investors are expected to sell the dollar aggressively if it rises to around 143.50 yen, dealers said. The U.S. Currency steadied well above 143.00 yen after Bank of Japan intervention and scattered short-covering, they said.

u.s. markets offer glimpse of volcker nightmare,money-fx interest,"Today's turmoil in the U.S. Financial markets, with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollar's wake, is evidence of a major shift in investor psychology that is likely to spell more turbulence ahead, economists said. For two years, the markets had hailed the dollar's decline as the cure-all for the U.S. Trade deficit. Interest rates fell sharply and Wall Street became a one-way street, up. But that confidence is now cracking as the financial markets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker's often-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse. ""Volcker's been saying for a long time that a dollar freefall would be extremely dangerous - now he's got it,"" said David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc. The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in 40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, short of further depreciation of the dollar. Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amid worries that the dollar's slide will rekindle inflation, scare away foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit. The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12 dlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spike in interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average down by 33 points to 2339. Norman Robertson, Mellon Bank chief economist, called the markets' instability frightening. He believes economic fundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that ""once you start the ball rolling it's difficult to stop."" ""There's a stark possibility that you could get a destabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates and drives us into recession. The markets are in a panic."" Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics in Washington, has been warning for a long time that the controlled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and 264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare. ""We're still more or less on track for a hard landing... But the agony may be fairly drawn out,"" Marris told Reuters. Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this year, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it would take very little to touch off what he calls the second phase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in the dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession. The stock market's reaction today and its sharp drop on March 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about. The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with historical experience, which teaches that domestic markets are not affected until a currency is in the final stages of its decline, Marris said. He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen. Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar's latest weakness was the loss of credibility that central banks suffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling below 150 yen, the floor that the market believes was set as part of the G-7 Paris agreement in February. Robertson at Mellon, by contrast, said the loss of confidence was triggered last week when Washington announced plans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronic imports, raising the specter of a debilitating trade war. Many economists believe that long-run stability will not return to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is addressed - excessive consumption in the U.S., Reflected in the massive budget deficit. But in the short term, given the failure of the G-7 and of central bank intervention, some feel that the Fed will have no choice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar. ""The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is a substantial increase in the discount rate and a corresponding cut abroad, at least by Japan,"" said Lanston's Jones. Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interest rates, even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for American farmers, Latin American governments and others. But Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs and Co, scoffed at the notion. ""It's ridiculous to think the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak against just one currency. This is yen strength, not dollar weakness,"" he said. Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being made toward reducing the U.S. Budget deficit. ""We're going to have one of the biggest reductions in the budget deficit relative to GNP in history this year, and nobody cares,"" he said, noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69 will have been greater. He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and thinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year. But for now, market psychology has changed so abruptly that a further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out. ""Put on your helmets,"" Giordano said."

"interest rate differentials too small, banker says",interest money-supply,"Swiss National Bank President Pierre Languetin said a wider interest rate differential between the dollar and stronger currencies was needed to brake the dollar's fall. At a news conference, he said Japan and West Germany could try to stimulate their economies further by expanding money supply, but he added ""I'm not so sure it would be desirable if monetary policy became more expansive. ""But what would be useful is a greater differential in interest rates,"" he said."
dry spell in philippines damages agriculture crops,grain corn rice,"A prolonged dry spell has damaged 111,350 hectares of rice and corn plantations in 10 provinces in the central and southern Philippines, agriculture officials said. They said some 71,070 tonnes of agricultural produce estimated at about 250 mln pesos was lost to the lack of rainfall. They warned of a severe drought if the prevailing conditions continued until next month. Agriculture Secretary Carlos Dominguez said he hoped the losses would be offset by the expected increase in output in other, normally more productive areas not affected by the dry spell. Affected were 14,030 hectares of palay (unmilled rice), representing a production loss of 22,250 tonnes valued at 77.8 mln pesos, Department of Agriculture reports said. About 48,820 tonnes of corn from 97,320 hectares valued at 170.8 mln pesos have also been lost, they said. Officials said the hectarage planted to palay that has been hit by the drought accounted for only one pct of national total thus the damage is considered negligible. In the case of corn, they said the loss can be filled by production from non-traditional corn farms which diversified into the cash crop from sugar two years ago. The Philippine Coconut Authority said coconut production in the major producing region of Bicol might drop by 25 pct to 320,000 tonnes if the dry spell continued. There were no reports of actual damage."
"australian government must cut spending, anz says",bop gnp cpi,"The government must announce harsh cuts in spending in its May 14 economic statement if it is to give an adequate response to Australia's economic problems, the ANZ Banking Group Ltd <ANZA.S> said. Cuts of two billion dlrs would be insufficient against the backdrop of a 12 billion dlr government deficit and a 14 billion dlr current account deficit, it said in its monthly Business Indicators publication. ""For the past two years, the government has struggled with an economic reality that demands measures beyond those which it sees as politically practicable,"" it said. The political climate meant there would be a continued over-reliance on monetary policy to hold the exchange rate and maintain confidence in economic management, ANZ said. ""The cost of this approach is that the much-needed revival of business investment will be further postponed,"" it said. The economy was now on a modest growth upswing boosted by export and import-replacement industries which had created a false suggestion that the worst adjustments to the balance of payments crisis were past. ""Unfortunately, successful adjustment to Australia's deep-seated economic problems remains a long-term process,"" it said. In its economic forecasts, ANZ said it expected moderate overall economic growth with gross domestic product (GDP) rising 2.7 pct this year and 2.4 pct in 1988. The current account deficit would narrow to five pct of GDP this year and 4.3 pct in 1988 and net foreign debt would grow strongly from 81 billion at the end of 1986 to 97.2 billion at end-1987 and 110.3 billion a year later. Inflation would fall to 8.5 pct in 1987 and 7.5 pct in 1988 from 8.9 pct in 1986 and further falls in real wages were expected, ANZ said."

"yugoslav economy worsened in 1986, bank data shows",trade wpi cpi income retail,"National Bank economic data for 1986 shows that Yugoslavia's trade deficit grew, the inflation rate rose, wages were sharply higher, the money supply expanded and the value of the dinar fell. The trade deficit for 1986 was 2.012 billion dlrs, 25.7 pct higher than in 1985. The trend continued in the first three months of this year as exports dropped by 17.8 pct, in hard currency terms, to 2.124 billion dlrs. Yugoslavia this year started quoting trade figures in dinars based on current exchange rates, instead of dollars based on a fixed exchange rate of 264.53 dinars per dollar. Yugoslavia's balance of payments surplus with the convertible currency area fell to 245 mln dlrs in 1986 from 344 mln in 1985. The National Bank said the drop was due to a deterioration in trade. Exports to the convertible currency area rose 11.6 pct from 1985, while imports rose 17.8 pct. Retail prices rose an average of 88.1 pct in 1986 while industrial producer prices rose by 70.6 pct, the bank's data showed. The cost of living rose by 89.1 pct. Personal incomes rose by 109 pct in 1986. Prime Minister Branko Mikulic warned in February that wages were too high given the level of productivity. Mikulic introduced a law cutting wages to the level of the last quarter of 1986 and tying future rises to productivity. Bank statistics show the overall 1986 rise in M-1 money supply was 109.1 pct with a year-end position of 3,895.9 billion dinars. Yugoslavs have 9.8 billion dlrs worth of foreign currency savings in the country and 20 billion dlrs abroad, mostly owned by workers employed in western Europe. The dinar fell by 73.1 pct against a basket of hard currencies in 1986. The highest depreciation was against the Swiss franc, 85.3 pct, and the lowest against the U.S. Dollar, 46.2 pct."
awb chairman urges farmers not to cut plantings,grain wheat,"Australia could lose valuable wheat markets through lack of availability if plantings for the coming 1987/88 season are significantly reduced, Australian Wheat Board (AWB) chairman Clinton Condon said. ""If predictions of a 30 pct decrease in plantings prove true, Australia may not be able to supply wheat to some of its valuable markets,"" he said in a statement. Condon did not say who had made the predictions, but an AWB spokesman said there was a general industry feeling that farmers, hard hit by low prices and rising costs, could cut back plantings sharply. Wheat sowing normally begins in May. However, Condon said he did not believe plantings would be cut by as much as 30 pct although he realised many farmers were facing enormous financial pressures. He said the AWB expects the area sown to be about 10.7 mln hectares, down from 11.3 mln in 1986/87 when the crop was about 16 mln tonnes. Final crop estimates for 1986/87 and planting intentions for 1987/88 are not yet available. If the AWB is unable, because of a short-term cut in plantings, to meet the needs of the markets it has developed with much time and effort, it may have great difficulty selling wheat to those markets in the future, Condon said. ""Markets which rely on a steady supply of Australian wheat understand a decrease in production due to drought but they will have difficulty understanding a deliberate decision to decrease production,"" Condon said. ""If Australia wants wheat to continue as a major export income earner, governments and government authorities will need to closely examine ways of contributing to the continuing viability of the wheat industry,"" he added. Australia's leading wheat markets include China, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, the Soviet Union and Japan."
china raises grain purchase prices,grain corn rice oilseed cottonseed groundnut,"China has raised the state purchase prices of corn, rice, cottonseed and shelled peanuts from April 1 to encourage farmers to grow them, the official China Commercial Daily said. The paper said the price paid for corn from 14 northern provinces, cities and regions has increased by one yuan per 50 kg. A foreign agricultural expert said the rise will take the price to 17 fen per jin (0.5 kg) from 16 fen. The paper said the price for long-grained rice from 10 southern provinces and cities was raised by 1.5 yuan per 50 kg. The paper said the price for round-grained rice from 11 provinces, regions and cities in central, east and northwest China has been increased by 1.75 yuan per 50 kg. It gave no more price details. It said local authorities must inform farmers of the price increases before farmers begin planting, to encourage production of grains and oilseeds. Chinese officials have said farmers are unwilling to grow grain because they can earn more from other crops."
institutes divided on outlook for german economy,gnp jobs bop cpi,"The five leading West German economic research institutes have failed to agree about how strongly the domestic economy will expand this year but revised down forecasts contained in a report published six months ago. The three research groups of Kiel, Hamburg and Essen predicted in the institutes' joint spring report that gross national product (GNP) would rise by two pct in 1987, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986. The five institutes had jointly forecast three pct 1987 growth in October last year. Taking a dissenting view, the DIW institute of West Berlin and Munich's Ifo institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth. The joint report said that the estimates of economic development made by the DIW and Ifo were ""markedly less favourable"" than those of the other three. The DIW and Ifo forecast the economy would pick up after a slow start to the year. ""In the second half of 1987 there will, however, only be a weak upward movement,"" they said. The two institutes said external economic factors which were currently damaging exports and pushing up imports would dominate the economic environment throughout the year. They saw exports falling by a real 2-1/2 pct in 1987 and predicted no marked improvement in the course of the year. The other three institutes, however, wrote: ""The decline in demand and production (seen) in the winter months does not indicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing."" They said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporate uncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans. But they expected that many investments had not been cancelled but only put off. ""It can be presumed that the braking actions (on the economy) will diminish markedly this year."" They added: ""The domestic prerequisites for a continuation of the economic uptrend are still favourable."" These three institutes said diminishing external burdens combined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn in demand and production could be expected by the spring. However, this projection was clouded by risks including the further development of the mark against the dollar. Contrary to the DIW and Ifo, the three institutes said that while exports would continue to be the weak point of the economy in 1987, ""there is good reason to believe that exports will soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge during the course of the year."" They predicted an overall 0.5 pct fall in exports in 1987, the same as in 1986. The three more positive institutes saw private consumption rising by four pct in 1987, compared with 4.2 pct in 1986, while DIW and Ifo predicted a three pct increase. They saw the climate for equipment investment improving but predicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 4.6 pct in 1986. Ifo and DIW saw these investments rising by only two pct. All the institutes predicted only a slight decline in unemployment. The Kiel, Hamburg and Essen institutes said the jobless total would average 2.17 mln in 1987 compared with 2.23 mln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people in work of about 200,000. These three institutes said new jobs would be created mainly in the private services sector and also by the state in the context of job creation measures. The construction industry was likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980 but they predicted either no rise in employment in the manufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion. The DIW and Ifo said rises in employment would occur only in the tertiary sector, while ""the number employed in the manufacturing industry will decline."" The DIW and Ifo said unemployment would only decline to 2.20 mln in 1987 from 2.23 mln in 1986. They saw the current account surplus falling in 1987 to 58 billion marks from 78 billion in 1986. The other three saw a current account surplus in 1987 of at least 60 billion marks and predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around 100 billion marks from 112 billion in 1986. The institutes agreed that consumer prices would start to rise in 1987, after they declined in 1986, and all five predicted an average increase over the year of 0.5 pct."

They said traders expected riyal deposits to follow the recent strong rise in eurodollar rates sparked by fears of a tighter U.S. Monetary policy to halt the dollar's slide. ""There was a wave of panic buying early in the morning as people tried to cover gaps and build long riyal positions,"" said one dealer. As a result, riyal deposits were strongly bid and traders scrambled for any available offers. One-way trade focused mainly on the fixed periods but short dates also rose, dealers said. Spot-next and one-week deposits climbed to 6-5/8, 1/8 pct from 6-3/8, six on Sunday. One-month deposits rose to 6-1/2, 3/8 pct from 6-1/4, six and three-month deposits climbed to 6-3/4, 5/8 pct from 6-9/16, 7/16. Six-month deposits also firmed to 7-1/8, seven pct from 7-1/16, 6-7/8 on Sunday. The spot riyal was steady at 3.7500/03 to the dollar after quotes of 3.7498/7503 yesterday."

It opened slightly firmer at 433.50/434.00 and moved up steadily during the morning supported by commission house and trade buying, dealers said. Dealers said there was resistance around 440.00 but with sentiment still firm some traders believe the rally may even take gold as high as 500 dlrs.

currency moves may be hurting world trade,money-fx trade,"Japanese trade figures are seriously challenging the entrenched view of policy makers of the Group of Seven industrialised nations that relative currency rates are the key to smoothing world trade problems. Senior Japanese, U.S. And European officials in Tokyo say they are at a loss to fully explain the data, for if currencies are the key they ask, why then are are U.S. Exports to Japan shrinking? What if manipulating currencies and driving the dollar down made world trade problems worse rather than solving them, fulfilling Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's forecast of world trade recession? U.S.-Japan trade has declined even after a 40 pct dollar fall against the yen since the September 1985 Group of Five pact in New York. The lower dollar ought to have made U.S. Exports 40 pct more competitive in Japan. The officials, most of them economists, can offer no objective reason why they are not. Worse, how are European Community sales to Japan rising rapidly when the European Currency Unit has until now declined only 11 pct against the yen.? Last week's G-7 meeting in Washington has been widely interpreted as a sign from the policy makers that the dollar must go lower. So worst of all, what if Volcker is correct? At a loss to give an objective explanation, officials can only offer explanations which tend to be highly subjective. ""I don't know and I don't think anyone knows,"" said Hugh Richardson, acting head of the EC delegation in Tokyo. ""What I do know is that Community exporters are making a hell of an effort in this market. If you make an effort, there is money to be made in Japan,"" he added. But U.S. Officials and businessmen are convinced low U.S. Exports to Japan are Japan's fault. They cite restrictive trade practices, protected Japanese trade sectors, such as agriculture, and non-tariff barriers, such as unreasonable checking and customs procedures for car imports. Publicly, Japanese officials remain conciliatory in the face of what they see as U.S. Aggression. In private, they blame U.S. Industry for being uncompetitive. ""We see it that way, but we don't like to seem arrogant,"" said a senior official, who declined to be named. ""We like to refrain from accusing them of not making enough effort."" Industrialists such as Eishiro Saito, chairman of the Keidanren business group, and Sony Corp chairman Akio Morita repeatedly accuse foreign firms of not making enough effort to understand Japan's markets, and some foreigners agree. ""The real issue is the inability of major sectors of American and European industry to compete not only internationally but even in their home markets,"" Peter Huggler, President of Interallianz Bank Zurich, told a recent conference in Switzerland.

portuguese economy remains buoyant despite crisis,gnp bop cpi,"Portugal's economy, which has been enjoying one of its most buoyant periods in more than a decade, may now be strong enough to shrug off the country's latest government crisis, analysts said. But the April 3 ousting of Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva's government could slow economic reforms and investment as Portugal continues to adapt to membership in the European Community, which it joined in January last year, they said. Cavaco Silva's minority Social Democratic Party, PSD, was toppled in a parliamentary censure vote by left-wing parties. The centre-right administration had made economic growth reform a priority in its 17 months in office. In 1986, Portugal's economy grew four pct, its current account surplus swelled to more than one billion dlrs and inflation fell to 10 pct, from 20 pct in 1985. Analysts and businessmen said the prospects of instability were worrying but they felt the foundations for continued growth had not been badly shaken. ""The economy has developed a certain self-confidence that is now less dependent on the political situation,"" said Fritz Haser, economics professor at Universidade Livre, Lisbon. ""The market doesn't see this as a real crisis yet,"" economist Jorge Braga de Macedo told Reuters. Businessmen have identified political instability over the last 13 years as one of the biggest obstacles to lasting economic progress. The PSD administration was the 16th formed since the 1974 revolution. Portugal's developing stock markets, however, remain buoyant. Brokers and unit trust managers said the recent surge in economic confidence under the PSD rule was still largely underpinned by continuing optimistic forecasts. Investment grew nearly 10 pct in 1986 and a Bank of Portugal forecast, released on the day the PSD government fell, predicted the pace of investment and overall economic growth would remain at similar levels this year. But analysts said the crisis interrupted current policies and could slow economic development. Soares, who is expected to announce a decision by the end of the month, can either call early elections or form a new government from parties in the existing left wing-dominated parliament. Many businessmen said they strongly favoured quick elections as the best solution. ""There is a good chance that a majority government could result from early elections,"" Confederation of Portuguese Industry (CIP) president Pedro Ferraz da Costa said. He said they were optimistic this could mean the continuation in the near future of liberalisation policies introduced over the last year. The left-wing parties favour a parliamentary solution, but the PSD said it wants an early election in which opinion polls say they could win an overall majority. A PSD majority would also open the way for more wide-ranging reforms, such as relaxation of labour laws and possible denationalisation of industry, the analysts said. Cavaco Silva has accused the left-wing opposition parties of blocking key economic reforms. The left-wingers said Portugal's positive economic results were more the product of favourable international conditions such as cheaper oil and raw material imports, than of PSD policies."

This week's estimated arrivals total 274,000 tonnes, of which 71,000 are grains/oilseeds and 203,000 derivatives. The figures cover around 95 pct of Rotterdam traffic in the products concerned."
german institutes warn on money supply,money-supply cpi gnp,"Four of West Germany's five leading economic research institutes warned that excessive monetary growth threatened a resurgence of inflation. But in a dissenting view the DIW institute in West Berlin, echoing recent statements by leading Bundesbank officials, said the expansion seen over the last 1-1/2 years did not necessarily threaten stability. The five institutes issued a joint spring report, in which three -- Kiel, Hamburg and Essen -- forecast a two pct rise in GNP in 1987, while West Berlin and Munich predicted one pct. The four institutes said an expansive policy was welcome in view of the slowdown in economic activity. But experience has shown that strong monetary growth eventually leads to a price rise which undoes the beneficial effects of monetary policy. Given virtual zero inflation in West Germany such fears may seem exaggerated, they said. ""But it has often turned out in the past that the price climate can quickly deteriorate, forcing the central bank into a restrictive policy,"" they said. The economic costs of a preventive stability policy are less than fighting inflation once it has taken hold, they said. The four institutes disputed the view that monetary expansion would slow of its own accord in 1987 as domestic investors switch liquidity into longer term capital market investments following lower interest rates. ""Such redispositions may temporarily dampen the expansion of central bank money stock, but do not automatically lead to a smaller expansion of money supply,"" they said. A return to growth and stability did not require spectacular central bank moves, but could be done quietly with open market operations and repurchase pacts, which would avoid an interest rate rise by dampening inflationary expectations. The DIW institute said monetary policy should not be focused simply on growth of production potential. Because of uncertainty about exchange rate developments and economic weakness other factors should be taken into account. Monetary policy should aim for further interest rate cuts and avoid rises to boost the economy and discourage revaluation speculation. Recent strong monetary expansion was not a threat in itself to price stability. The 1979/81 inflation following strong 1977/78 money growth reflected other causes, such as rising oil prices and the falling mark."
usda changes low protein wheat terminal prices,grain wheat,"The U.S. Agriculture Department has lowered its ASCS terminal prices for low protein hard red winter and hard red spring wheat at a number of locations, a senior USDA official said. USDA reduced the price of hard red winter wheat at Kansas City and Texas by six cents, at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32 cents and at St Louis by nine cents, Ralph Klopfenstein, deputy administrator of commodity operations at the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, said. The department also lowered the terminal price of hard red spring wheat at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32 cents, he said. In addition, USDA cut the Pacific Northwest price of hard red spring wheat by 31 cents, USDA officials who asked not to be identified said. The officials said hard red spring wheat prices at Chicago, Denver and Toledo were adjusted by about the same amount as at Pacific Northwest, Duluth and Minneapolis. The price changes should lead to a pickup of PIK and roll activity, Klopfenstein said. The price change was decided upon last week and will be effective today, he said. Klopfenstein also said the department raised the premiums on high protein wheat to offset the drop in low protein wheat prices, meaning the net price on any wheat commanding a protein premium would remain unchanged."

soviet tankers set to carry kuwaiti oil,crude ship,"Kuwait has agreed to charter tankers from the Soviet Union in a move to protect its oil exports through the Mideast Gulf, diplomatic sources said. They said the agreement followed months of talks with the Soviet Union and the U.S. On ways to secure its oil exports after Iran started to attack Kuwaiti-connected vessels in retaliation for Kuwait's backing for Iran's war enemy Iraq. Diplomats said they expect three Soviet tankers initially to reinforce other flags already supporting Kuwait's 22-tanker fleet. The diplomats said they knew of no deal for Moscow to provide a naval escort for its own vessels, but ""the idea of protection is implicit,"" one said. They said Soviet cargo ships bound for Kuwait in the past to unload arms and materiel for road delivery to Iraq were known to have sailed under escort. So far, none of the Soviet ships are known to have been attacked by Iran. Diplomats said they expected the chartered Soviet tankers to sail between Kuwait and Khor Fakkan on the United Arab Emirates (UAE) coast a short way outside the Strait of Hormuz at the mouth of the Gulf."

italy's buitoni acquires vismara food group,acq earn,"Carlo De Benedetti's food company Industrie Buitoni Perugina Spa said it has acquired the Italian food group Vismara. Buitoni said in a statement that Vismara had 1986 sales of 181 billion lire and net profit of 11 billion lire, employs 950 people and has four subsidaries. Buitoni did not disclose financial details about the acquisition. De Benedetti said last week that his group was negotiating a purchase of an unidentified Italian food firm. Vismara primarily produces a variety of pork products. ""The acquisition represents a diversification in a market sector with annual consumption of 8,500 billion lire,"" Buitoni said. Buitoni also said its consolidated revenue during the first quarter of this year was 429 billion lire, up 51 pct from the comparable 1986 period. As reported, Buitoni's consolidated revenue rose last year to 1,623 billion lire from 1,177 billion in 1985. Net profit rose to 18.5 billion lire from 448 mln lire in 1985."

goodyear <gt> to sell celeron,acq earn,"Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co said it expects to sell its Celeron Corp oil and gas subsidiary for about two billion dlrs in about two months. After the company's annual meeting, Rober Mercer, Goodyear's chairman and chief executive officer, also said Goodyear expects to report a profit of more than one dlr a share from continuing operations in the first quarter. In the same year-ago period, Goodyear reported a loss of 64 cents a share from continuing operations. Mercer said about seven companies are interested in buying Celeron and they may form a consortium to buy the unit. Celeron consists of oil and gas reserves and an almost complete pipeline linking drilling operations in Santa Barbara, Calif., to Texas refineries. Mercer said Celeron's reserves would not be sold separately from the pipeline. Concerning speculation that two billion dlr price tag for Celeron was too high, Mercer said ""There is no fire sale going on here and we can continue to keep Celeron as a profitable operation throughout the year."" Mercer said the expected 1st quarter operating profit was based on the new share total after Goodyear's share repurchase last year to fend off Sir James Goldsmith's hostile takeover bid."

ec meat directive deadline seen flexible,carcass livestock,"U.S. officials said they held out little hope the European Community, EC, would withdraw a controversial meat inspection requirement, due to go into effect April 30 and which U.S. meat producers claim will cut off their exports. But the officials said they expect the EC to allow U.S. plants to continue shipping meat through the end of the year provided they submit a plant improvement program with the U.S. Agriculture Department. The EC's so-called Third Country Meat Directive will require foreign meat processing plants to comply fully with EC inspection standards beginning April 30. The U.S. meat industry has prepared a petition requesting the Reagan administration to retaliate against the EC rule. At issue are U.S. meat exports to the EC valued at 132 mln dlrs in 1985. The EC rule would require all U.S. plants to make changes in their inspection methods, ranging from veterinary staffing to use of wood. Last December, the EC determined that only one U.S. cattle, one hog and one sheep slaughtering facility could be approved without further review. USDA would have to certify that the plants had corrected the deficiencies. All remaining plants with a history or potential of shipping to the EC -- totaling nearly 400 -- would require more significant changes in plant constructions or procedures before further EC review. Robert Hibbert, general counsel for the American Meat Institute, said the meat industry expected to submit a formal trade retaliation petition by April 30. An interagency committee is reviewing the industry's draft petition. An official at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said U.S. officials continued to press the EC to withdraw the rule, but that ""the chances of that are not too good at this time."" However, there is the ""expectation"" in U.S. government and meat industry circles that the EC will continue to allow shipments, at least through the end of the calendar year, from U.S. plants that submit to USDA a plan on how they will bring their operations into conformity with the EC regulation, the USTR official said."
u.s. banks likely to lift prime rates again soon,interest money-fx,"Major U.S. banks may lift prime lending rates again within days due to recent increases in their borrowing costs and speculation the Federal Reserve is nudging up interest rates to help the dollar, economists said. In what was the first prime rate boost since mid-1984, most banks in early April lifted their rates a quarter point to 7-3/4 pct, citing a reduced gap between the prime and their own cost of money. That spread has narrowed again. ""A prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight,"" said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc. Brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct is justified because the spread between banks' cost of funds and the prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of a percentage point. He said that spread had averaged around 1.4 percentage points since last October until it fell below one point and triggered the April prime rate rise at most banks. ""We could easily have another prime rate increase as soon as this week,"" said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co. ""We've got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in the near future,"" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp. ""Based on the spread between the prime rate and funding costs, you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now,"" said Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank. However, he said banks may be reluctant to lift the prime because that would dampen already fairly weak business loan demand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintain recent upward pressure on money market interest rates. Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures lift short-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar. He said ""if there is widespread belief money market rates will stay high, a prime rate rise could occur at any time."" Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep a dollar drop could help rekindle U.S. inflation. As the dollar fell to a 40-year low against the yen Friday, currency traders said the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar. In addition to buying dollars outright, another way to stabilize the U.S. currency would be for the Fed to push U.S. interest rates higher relative to overseas rates. Based particularly on the Fed's reserve management actions on Friday and today, Nathan of Wells Fargo said ""it has become clear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressure in the market. It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed."" Bank funding costs and other short and long-term interest rates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculation that the Fed is gently firming monetary policy. That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in the market than most economists had expected. On Friday, the Fed added reserves indirectly and in small amounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements with the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another high at 6-5/16 pct. With funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pct today, the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlr round of customer repurchase agreements. ""The Fed's actions on Friday and today show that it is offering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures,"" said Jones of Lanston. ""The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the need to defend the dollar,"" Jones said. He believes it is merely shading policy toward restraint now, ""but to have a major impact on the dollar, the Fed will have to tighten policy overtly at some point."" Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates by becoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and, within four to six weeks, to raise its discount rate from 5-1/2 pct. Jones said a U.S. discount rate increase to six pct might well be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts to further aid the dollar. Given likely Fed policy firming, he said both the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds (about 8.30 pct now) and the prime rate may be at 8-1/2 pct at end-June and nine pct by year's end. ""The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tightening policy to defend the dollar,"" said Leslie of Discount Corp. He said tax-date pressures have been pushing up Fed funds lately. Leslie said Fed actions and reserve data once these pressures abate will show whether or not it is firming policy."

taiwan likely to buy more u.s. soybeans,veg-oil soybean,"A 50 pct cut in the import tariff for soybeans should help boost 1987 U.S. Soybean exports to Taiwan, a spokesman for the joint committee of soybean importers told Reuters. He said the cut to 3.5 from seven pct was approved by the cabinet yesterday and would go into effect within a week. The cut will encourage local importers to increase 1987 soybean imports to 1.9 mln tonnes from 1.74 mln last year, he said. The previous target for 1987 was 1.81 tonnes. Taiwan imports more than 90 pct of its soybeans from the U.S. And the rest from South America. The spokesman said the increase in imports from the U.S. Is in line with government efforts to reduce Taiwan's trade surplus with Washington, which rose to 3.61 billion U.S. Dlrs in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78 billion a year ago. ""The tariff cut is very helpful for American suppliers (who want) to boost their exports to Taiwan,"" Steve Chen, country director of the American Soybean Association, told Reuters."

u.s. urges japan to open farm market further,grain trade,"U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng has asked Japan to open its farm market further to help Washington cut its trade deficit and ease protectionist pressures, an Agriculture Ministry official told reporters. Hideo Maki, Director General of the ministry's Economic Affairs Bureau, quoted Lyng as telling Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato that the removal of import restrictions would help Japan as well as the United States. The meeting with Kato opened a 12-day visit to Japan by Lyng, who is here to dicuss farm trade. However, Maki quoted Kato as replying that Japan was already the world's largest grain importer. Kato added Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Grain and depended on domestic output for only 53 pct of its food requirements in 1985. Lyng said the U.S. Put high priority on talks on 12 farm products named in U.S. Complaints against Japan to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) last year, as well as on beef, citrus products and rice. Kato said Japan will maintain its current level of self-sufficiency and will try not to produce surplus rice because potential production is higher than domestic demand. The world farm market suffers from surpluses because of rising production by exporting countries, he added. Lyng said the U.S. Has been trying to reduce farm product output with expensive programs, Maki said. Maki said the U.S. And Japan will hold detailed discussions on each trade item as well as a new round of GATT trade talks at a meeting on April 20, in which U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter will join."
"60,000 tonnes corn smuggled into philippines-paper",grain corn,"At least 60,000 tonnes of corn worth 240 mln pesos have been smuggled into the Philippines over the past few months, the Manila Bulletin newspaper said, quoting an official in the National Food Authority (NFA). The official, who was not named, said a large corn shortage and corruption among customs and Coast Guard personnel have jeopardised the government's ban on corn imports, which was aimed at saving foreign currency. The newspaper quoted NFA Marketing Director Jig Tan as saying monthly corn consumption stood at about 331,000 tonnes against a national stock inventory of 191,732 tonnes. Tan said a continuing drought affecting about 49,150 hectares of corn has led to the loss of 43,725 tonnes of corn worth 174.9 mln pesos and contributed to the shortage. The newspaper quoted Linda Geraldez, an NFA statistician, as saying despite the drought and the shortage, the total inventory at the end of the January/June crop season is expected to be at least 201,000 tonnes."
paper says u.s. trade deficit cut to 13.65 billion,bop trade,"The Washington Post said the U.S. Commerce Department yesterday issued a new report showing that the U.S. Merchandise trade deficit was 13.65 billion dollars in February, a reduction of 1.4 billion dlrs from the 15.06 billion figure the department reported only two days earlier. The newspaper said: ""News of the unexpectedly large 15 billion deficit helped batter the dollar's value on foreign exchange markets and boosted U.S. Interest rates. ""However, the new report went largely unnoticed by financial markets since such a downward revision in the deficit is a monthly occurrence."" The Washington Post said: ""By law, the department must first publish what a top commerce official agreed are misleading trade figures and then wait 48 hours before putting out the more accurate ones."" No one was immediately available at the Commerce Department for comment on the Washington Post report."
"china trade deficit falls sharply, reserves rise",trade reserves,"China's trade deficit in the first quarter fell to 1.05 billion dlrs from 3.04 billion in the same 1986 period, customs figures show. Zhang Zhongji, spokesman of the State Statistical Bureau, quoted the figures as showing exports rose 27 pct to 7.28 billion dlrs and imports fell 5.1 pct to 8.33 billion. He said if imports of gifts, foreign aid items and materials for joint ventures are excluded, the deficit was only 350 mln dlrs, and the surplus on invisibles was 700 mln. As a result, foreign exchange reserves increased somewhat from their level at end-1986, he said, but gave no figure. Official figures show the reserves at 10.514 billion dlrs at end-1986, down from 11.9 billion at end-1985. Zhang said one reason for the rise in exports was improved incentives to export firms, which are being allowed to retain more foreign exchange from the goods they sell. He said first quarter exports to Hong Kong and Macao rose 35.5 pct to 2.48 billion dlrs and imports rose 55.3 pct to 1.46 billion. Exports to Japan fell 2.3 pct to 1.28 billion and imports 24.4 pct to 2.14 billion. Exports to the U.S. Rose 23 pct to 640 mln dlrs and imports fell 26.7 pct to 840 mln. Exports to the EEC rose 35.1 pct to 770 mln dlrs and imports fell 3.8 pct to 1.5 billion, he said."
lyng opens japan talks on farm trade barriers,trade carcass orange rice,"U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng opens talks with Japanese government officials today well aware his demand for the opening of Japanese rice, beef and citrus markets is likely to be rejected. But in an interview with Reuters during the flight to Tokyo yesterday, Lyng said the goal of his trip was to throw an international spotlight on Japan's agricultural import protection in the hope pressure would build on Tokyo to open its markets. ""(The Japanese) have said they are happy we are coming, but they are not going to give us anything,"" Lyng said. U.S. Officials do not expect any Japanese concessions during Lyng's two-week visit here. Any farm trade concessions would be unveiled later this month, they said. ""If there is anything of consequence to offer (Prime Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone would take it with him,"" when he visits Washington later in the month, one U.S. Official said. Lyng plans to ask Japan to open the door to rice imports by partially lifting the longstanding ban on foreign purchases. A private U.S. Rice trader visited Tokyo last week requesting Japan buy 200,000 tonnes of rice for industrial uses such as making sake. Japan has rejected the overture, saying Tokyo maintains a policy of self-sufficiency in rice. Lyng will also press Japan to eliminate an import quota for beef by April 1988 because he believes Japanese consumers would like to buy much more beef than currently allowed. He cited the example of a California company which transports live U.S. Cattle to Japan by air for slaughter to circumvent the beef quota. The cost of transport is higher than the value of the animal, he said. U.S. Officials said the Japan Livestock Industry Promotion Corporation which regulates beef imports, was forced to borrow from the fiscal 1987 quota earlier this year because the 1986 quota was exhausted and Japanese beef prices were rising. Japan has said it cannot open its markets to beef imports. Along with beef, the U.S. Will also press Japan to eliminate import quotas on fresh oranges and orange juice by April, 1988. Some U.S. Officials believe Japan may eventually be willing to scrap the quota on fresh oranges because liberalized trade would not necessarily damage the Japanese mandarin orange industry. The quota on juice may be harder to eliminate because imports might replace domestic produced juice, U.S. And Japanese officials have said. Lyng has resurrected a past U.S. Proposal that Japan buy surplus U.S. Foodgrains for donation to developing countries, but some U.S. Officials are skeptical action will be taken. Lyng will also urge Japan to put its domestic farm policies, including rice, on the negotiating table during GATT talks in Geneva. He said Japan must eliminate import quotas on certain minor food products or face possible U.S. Reprisals."

"japan rice policy extreme protectionism, lyng says",grain rice trade,"Japan's policy of self-sufficiency in rice is an example of extreme protectionism, visiting U.S. Agriculture secretary Richard Lyng told a press conference. He told the National Press Club of Japan that because Japan had a large export balance, not just with the U.S. But with other countries, it was inconsistent for it to be 100 pct self-sufficient in one product. Speaking after farm trade talks with Japan agriculture minister Mutsuki Kato, Lyng said the U.S. Had not asked for total liberalisation of the rice market in Japan. Lyng urged Japan to allow some imports of rice. ""We want to have some access in the rice market,"" he said. He said both he and trade representative Clayton Yeutter were disappointed at the outcome of talks with Japan. He told reporters Japan had rejected the U.S. Proposal to open negotiations on rice at the new round of trade talks at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Lyng said he suggested instead bilateral talks with Japan on rice. Kato has said Japan cannot negotiate on its policy of rice self-sufficiency. Asked what the next U.S. Step would be on the rice issue, Lyng said he did not know what Yeutter or the U.S. Rice industry would do. Yeutter has promised to consider again in July or August this year a complaint against Japan's rice import ban by the U.S. Rice Millers Association if no breakthrough is made in the meantime. U.S. Rice industry officials have indicated they would consider filing another complaint against the Japan rice import ban."

Speaking to the National Press Club of Japan, Lyng said protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Has increased alarmingly during the last six months. ""It is a radically changed situation and is very explosive. We are on the verge of some very harsh mandatory retaliatory laws which would have very serious consequences for other countries, especially Japan,"" Lyng told reporters. Lyng's comments about protectionist trade legislation appeared to be a reference to the so-called Gephardt provision, requiring retaliation against countries which have trade surpluses with the U.S., Trade analysts said. U.S. House majority leader Thomas Foley, a Washington Democrat, yesterday predicted during a visit here that the Gephardt provision will be approved by the House when trade legislation is taken up later this month. Senior Japanese officials do not seem to perceive the volatility of the situation in the U.S., Where Congress is increasingly unpredictable, he said. ""The purpose of this trip is to emphasise the fact that patience is beginning to be very much frayed in Washington. I cannot emphasise that enough,"" Lyng said. In talks with Japanese Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato yesterday, Lyng and Trade representative Clayton Yeutter asked Japan to begin negotiations on its rice policy and end import quotas on beef and citrus. Lyng said he was disappointed Kato rejected the U.S. Request but hoped it would not lead to a protectionist response in Congress, where legislation on rice retaliation has been introduced in both the House and Senate. Lyng said the U.S. Is dependent on Japan as a market for exports because Japan has been the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products since 1964, especially grains. He said the U.S. Understands Japan, with a limited land area, is concerned about maintaining some level of self-sufficiency in food for national security reasons. But he argued the freeing of farm product imports would not necessarily weaken Japanese agriculture. Lyng pledged the U.S. Will never again embargo shipments of farm products as it did in 1973."
world bank suggests more open economy for india,trade gnp bop reserves money-fx,"The World Bank has suggested India should move to a more open economy by gradually removing most government controls on industry and adopting a liberal external trade policy with reduced levels of protection. A confidential ""executive summary"" of a draft Bank report on the Indian economy was made available to Reuters. It suggests liberalisation as part of a package of reforms to boost exports of Indian goods by making them more competitive. The summary said, ""These reforms would result in (domestic) prices much more in line with world prices than is true today, and in a greater degree of import competition and export rivalry than the nation has ever seen."" The summary said foreign trade must play a key role in India's transition towards a more dynamic economy. Liberal imports of capital goods would help modernise the economy and expose Indian producers to foreign competition. Larger exports would provide the foreign exchange for imports. ""The main guideline is unambiguously to abandon the present principle of unlimited protection for all indigenously available products and to recognise the role of actual or potential competition from imports as a source of discipline on the prices and costs of public and private sector domestic manufacturers,"" the summary said. An Indian official told Reuters the government was discussing the report with the Bank. A final report with some changes was likely to be ready by May, but he declined to give further details. The Bank and industrialised nations will discuss the Bank's final report at a meeting in Paris on June 22 and 23 to discuss aid for India in the 1987/88 year starting in June. The summary said India's gross domestic product (gdp) grew at an average five pct in Indian fiscal years 1985/86 and 1986/87, which ended in March. It said investment was being sustained at nearly 25 pct of gdp. Almost 94 pct of the investment was being financed by national savings, mainly from the private sector. India's trade deficit is officially said to have narrowed to 5.6 billion dlrs in 1986/87 ended March, from a record 6.96 billion dlrs in 1985/86. The current account deficit fell to 2.4 billion dlrs in 1986/87 from 2.88 billion in 1985/86. But the summary said the improvement was largely due to lower prices of crude oil, petroleum products and fertilisers which make up the bulk of India's import bill. India was able to save about 2.6 billion dlrs in foreign exchange in 1986/87 due to lower prices of those products, the summary said. The Bank's summary said there was little room for complacency in the balance of payments position. It said that despite a lower trade deficit in 1986/87, Indian foreign exchange reserves fell by 240 mln dlrs. Real export growth would need to average at least 6.1 pct a year in value terms in the coming years to maintain a viable balance of payments, the summary said. It did not explicitly suggest the rupee should be devalued. India ""might have to reaffirm the commitment to exporting while undertaking some dramatic changes in general incentives that involve some political costs,"" it said. ""An example of such a policy would be the adoption of an exchange rate regime that maintained exporters' profitability,"" the summary said. It said such an approach had been successful in countries such as South Korea, Colombia and Turkey. It would maintain the competitiveness of Indian exports and simultaneously reduce import pressures. Earlier this year, the Indian government denied that the World Bank asked it to devalue the Indian rupee to boost exports."

falconbridge <falcf.o> sees improved results,nickel acq,"Falconbridge Ltd said it expected results for the rest of 1987 to improve from the earlier reported first quarter operating loss of 15.4 mln dlrs. Chief executive William James told reporters after the annual meeting that ""I would hope that the loss for the year certainly wouldn't be a high as the loss for the first quarter. In other words we are going to make money from here on in."" Falconbridge last year made a first quarter operating loss of 17.1 mln dlrs and a full-year operating loss of 15.5 mln dlrs. James said currency losses tied to the stronger Canadian dollar resulted for about eight mln dlrs of the first quarter operating loss. Falconbridge records its cash and accounts receivable in U.S. dollars, with the Canadian dollar equivalent decreasing as the U.S. dollar falls. He said the first quarter loss also stemmed from weaker nickel and ferronickel prices and lower production at the company's Sudbury, Ontario nickel operations and at some Kidd Creek operations. Falconbridge anticipates higher production through the rest of the year and higher average prices this year for precious metals, James added, without elaborating. Falconbridge has no immediate plans for further divestments, James said in reply to reporters' inquiries. The company sold several mining subsidiaries last year to help pay down debt from its January, 1986 acquisition of Kidd Creek Mines Ltd from Canada Development Corp <CDC.TO>. He said Falconbridge's debt now totaled about one billion dlrs, down from 1.37 billion dlrs at the time of the Kidd Creek buy. James said he could not assess the impact of Amoco Corp <AN>'s proposed acquisition of Dome Petroleum Ltd <DMP>. Dome's 23 pct-owned Dome Mines Ltd <DM> owns 21 pct of Falconbridge. Asked by reporters if Falconbridge preferred competing Dome bidder, Calgary, Alberta-based TransCanada PipeLines Ltd to Chicago-based Amoco, James replied, ""It makes no difference to me...whoever takes it over is fine by us."" He told shareholders that Falconbridges' planned capital expenditures this year would decline to 134 mln dlrs from 160 mln dlrs last year."

creative monetary policy to spur kuwaiti economy,interest money-fx gnp,"Kuwait, a major oil producer hit by last year's price slump, is leaning towards a more creative monetary policy to help spur its economy, banking sources said. ""There is a clear emphasis on encouraging the use of money in productive ventures, rather than having it all tied up in interest bearing investments which have no direct productive outlet,"" one banker said. Kuwait's Central Bank yesterday cut one key money market rate and abandoned another which had been used since February 1986 to direct inter-bank borrowing and lending costs. The bank reduced to six pct from 6-1/2 pct the rate at which it will offer funds of one month to one year in the inter-bank market. This, in turn, affected retail rates. The cut, the third this year, followed a major overhaul of interest rate policy last month which Central Bank Governor Sheikh Salem Abdul-Aziz al-Sabah said was designed to revive the economy. One banker said ""There is growing flexibility, creativity, in interest rate policy, amid an awareness of the need to diversify the economy by stimulating the non-oil sector."" For the first time in nearly three years domestic interest rates are now significantly below those for the U.S. Dollar, a favourite haven for Gulf speculative and investor funds in the past, banking sources said. Despite uncertainties generated by the 6-1/2 year old Iran- Iraq war on Kuwait's northern doorstep, bankers play down the prospect of any significant capital flight. The Kuwaiti dinar, whose value is set by the Central Bank and was fixed today at 0.27095/129 to the dollar, is stronger now than for several years. Fears that the dollar may fall further will prompt second thoughts among Kuwaiti investors prepared to consider switching funds into the U.S. Currency, the sources said. ""There is a distinct exchange rate risk,"" they added. Bankers said the dollar slump hurt many investors behind the last major capital outflow in 1984, encouraged then by 18 pct U.S. Interest rates and the start of Iranian attacks on neutral shipping in the Gulf. The Central Bank calculates its dinar exchange rate against a basket of currencies. Bankers do not know the basket's exact make-up but say it is weighted heavily in favour of the dollar. Some bankers believe any strengthening of the dinar beyond 0.27000 to the dollar might provoke investors into shifting funds into the U.S. Currency. ""They may ask:When will the dollar be so cheap again?"" one said. And with dinar interest rates now roughly one pct below those for the dollar, they say the Central Bank faces a delicate balancing role requiring further flexibility. Bankers said the current, expansionary interest rate policy is only part of a broader attempt to encourage local investment and strengthen the backbone of the economy. They estimate the economy, measured in terms of GDP and allowing for inflation, shrank 19 pct in 1986 after an 8.1 pct contraction the previous year. Bankers also noted recent measures to stimulate stock market activity, capped today by sharp cuts in brokerage fees to make it cheaper for investors to trade."

shell canada <shc.to> sees better year,crude nat-gas pet-chem acq,"Shell Canada Ltd said performance in all business segments in the first quarter showed improvement over last year and it expects ""significantly enhanced performance"" in 1987. Shell Canada reported first quarter earnings of 103 mln dlrs, or 90 cts per share, up from 40 mln dlrs, or 32 cts per share. Oil products earnings were 38 mln dlrs, up 19 mln dlrs from last year, when margins were impaired by lower oil prices. Shell Canada said chemical earnings were 17 mln dlrs in the quarter, compared with a loss of five mln dlrs in 1986. The styrene business saw significant improvement, stemming from an increase in international demand. Resources earnings increased by six mln dlrs to 46 mln dlrs. Lower prices for all commodities were offset by the removal of the Petroleum and Gas Revenue Tax, the impact of lower royalty rates and higher volumes. Gross production of crude oil and natural gas liquids increased seven pct from the first quarter of last year to 11,200 cubic meters a day, Shell said. Shell Canada also said natural gas sales volumes of 19.6 mln cubic meters a day was up five pct from last year. Sulphur sales of 4,143 tonnes a day were up 70 pct. The company also recorded benefits of 10 mln dlrs from the acquisition of Shell Explorer Ltd.

swiss growth seen slowing this year and next,gnp trade cpi jobs,"The growth of the Swiss economy will likely slow to 2.2 pct this year and 1.9 pct in 1988 after reaching 2.8 pct last year, according to a study by a group at Basle University's Institute of Applied Economics. It blamed the expected slowdown partly on a disappointing outlook for exports caused by the weaker dollar. Exports would likely grow by 2.8 pct this year and by 3.0 pct in 1988, after 3.0 pct in 1986, the group predicted. Final domestic demand will also fall back, to a likely 3.0 pct this year and 2.3 pct next, after 4.1 pct in 1986. However, the domestic picture will likely be mixed. The study said investment in plant and equipment would continue to be the main motor for the growth in domestic demand, although it was unlikely to grow as fast as last year's 7.4 pct, rising this year by 4.5 pct and by 2.8 pct in 1988. While the growth in private consumption is expected to fall back to 2.5 pct this year and 2.1 pct in 1988 from last year's 3.1 pct, public consumption spending will likely grow by 1.9 pct in 1987 and 2.0 pct next year, after 1.5 pct in 1986. Consumer prices were seen rising by 1.7 pct this year and 2.4 pct in 1988, after just 0.8 pct in 1986. Unemployment should fall back to 0.7 pct from last year's 0.8 pct."

ec to offer argentina grain sale compensation,grain corn sorghum,"The European Community is to offer Argentina compensation for its loss of maize and sorghum exports to Spain following Spain's accession to the EC, EC sources said. They said the offer will be made next week in Geneva, headquarters of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and will also involve products other than cereals. They gave no further details. Argentine exports of sorghum to Spain fell to zero last year from 300,000 tonnes in 1985, while maize sales fell to 15,000 tonnes from 994,000, official EC statistics show. The sources noted that an agreement between the EC and the U.S. guarantees special access to the Spanish market for two mln tonnes of non-EC maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum each year for the next four years. But they said various details of this accord will tend to inhibit imports from Argentina. These include a provision for reduction of the amounts if Spain imports cereals substitutes, and the EC's plan to import the special maize and sorghum on a regular monthly basis. Argentina tends to have exportable quantities only three or four times a year."

"exxon <xon> net drops on lower oil, gas prices",crude nat-gas,"Exxon Corp reported a 37 pct drop in first quarter profits to 1.07 billion dlrs citing lower oil and gas prices. The company said profits in the lastest quarter included a 26 mln drl restructuring gain from divestment of certain gold operations overseas, while last year's first quarter profit of 1.71 billion dlrs included the initial charge of 235 mln dlrs for its 1986 corporate reorganization. First quarter revenues were down 13 pct to 19.44 billion dlrs. One time items aside, Exxon said, its first quarter results were stronger than 1986's final quarter which included several large asset sales and positive inventory adjustments. It said earnings per share declined 36 pct reflecting the company's continued purchases of its own common for the treasury. During the first quarter, 5,085,000 shares were acquired at a cost of 416 mln dlrs compared with 3,132,000 in 1986's fourth quarter. Commenting on the first quarter, Exxon said crude oil prices strengthened moderately within the quarter and were higher than a year ago at the end of the quarter. However, average crude prices for the quarter were below the year ago period, leading to lower earnings for exploration and production operations, Exxon said. Also contributing to reduced earnings were lower natural gas prices, primarily overseas, representing contract adjustments representing contract adjustments tied to falling product prices in 1986, the company said. During the first quarter, the company said, intense competition in both domestic and international markets served to depress margins for refined products. Exxon said the lower product margins resulted in significantly reduced earnings for refining and marketing operations, contrasting sharply with the unusually strong margins prevailing in the first qtr of 1986. It said savings from efforts to control costs and improve efficiency helped soften the negative impact of lower oil and natural gas prices. Exxon said earnings from chemicals and power generation activities showed consideratble improvement, remaining strong throughout the period."

It also said there was a decline in crude oil production due to its recently completed asset sales program. Phillips also said it expects crude prices will continue to be soft in the second and third quarters, but will improve toward the end of the year. Phillips also said that foreign currency transaction losses in the first quarter were 10 mln dlrs compared with a gain of 46 mln dlrs in the fourth quarter of 1986 and a loss of one mln dlrs in the first quarter of 1986."
venezuela re-establishes posted product prices,crude fuel gas naphtha jet nat-gas,"Petroleos de Venezuela, PDVSA, the state owned oil company, has re-established posted prices for some light products and heavy fuel oil, industry sources in New York said. The return to posted prices is a sign that the market is returning to a more stable and orderly condition after a year of volatile price movements in which Venezuela ceased posting prices and moved to negotiating prices with companies. ""We are in more stable market now and PDVSA has probably decided to return to postings for some products,"" one industry trade source said. But there was no talk of Venezuela posting prices for crude oil which were also dropped in 1986. Posted prices were dropped in the first quarter of 1986 when prices for crude oil and products tumbled in response to OPEC's market share strategy and netback arrangements. PDVSA has set out posted prices for several groups of light products including gasoline, naphtha, jet kerosene and distillates effective April 15 as follows. Unleaded gasoline was posted at 19.74 dlrs a barrel (47 cts a gallon) with leaded gasoline at 20.16 dlrs a barrel (48 cts a gallon). Light naphtha was posted at 17.85 dlrs a barrel (42.5 cts a gallon), full range naphtha at 19.11 dlrs a barrel (45.50 cts a gallon), and heavy naphtha at 19.53 cts a gallon (46.5 cts a gallon). Jet kerosene was posted at 18.90 dlrs a barrel, also effective April 15, or (45 cts a gallon) with dual purpose kerosene at 18.06 dlrs a barrel (43 cts a gallon). Distillates of 0.2 pct sulphur and 0.3 pct sulphur grades were posted at 18.48 dlrs a barrel (44 cts a gallon), each with 0.5 pct sulphur 18.08 dlrs a barrel (43.05 cts a gallon). LPG postings, also effective from April 15, were made as follows, propane 175 dlrs a tonne (33.33 cts a gallon), butane 210 dlrs a tonne (46.26 cts a gallon) and isobutane at 240 dlrs a tonne. Heavy fuel products were given a posted price effective April 10 and ranged from 0.3 pct sulphur at 19.35 dlrs a barrel to 17.21 dlrs a barrel for 2.8 pct sulphur. Heavy fuel postings are also referred to as minimum export prices."

zimbabwe banking corp urges policy reform,bop ipi trade,"A range of substantial policy initiatives need to be implemented to shift resources from consumption to production in the Zimbabwe economy, says the Zimbabwe Banking Corporation (ZBC) in its quarterly economic review. The state owned banking group says although Zimbabwe's balance of payments improved significantly last year the underlying position deteriorated. Last year's improved trade surplus was partly the result of sales of stockpiled gold and continued import restraint. It says debt service charges are projected to exceed 35 pct of exports in 1987 and warns against squeezing imports further. ZBC says mining industry import quotas for the first six months of 1987 have been halved and those for manufacturing industry cut by a third. It contrasts the performance of manufacturing industry in 1967 to 1974, with that since independence in 1980. Industrial production almost doubled between 1967 and 1974, when foreign currency allocations almost trebled in real terms. Since 1980, import allocations have been cut 45 pct and the Zimbabwe dollar has depreciated by more than 60 pct. As a result the bank says the external purchasing power of foreign currency allocations is currently only 20 pct of its 1980 levels."

A spokesman for the United Steelworkers of America, which represents the workers, reiterated that private mediation talks are set for Monday and that no strike date had been set. The union has said it is asking for a three pct wage hike in each year of a proposed two-year contract, while Cominco has offered a 40 ct an hour increase in the third year of a proposed contract if workers agree to loosen rules on job classifications. The average unionized worker's wage is now about 14.78 dlrs an hour. Cominco's Trail operations produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long tons of lead in 1986. The Sullivan mine at Kimberley produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year, most for processing at the Trail smelter."

german growth will not cut u.s. deficit -bangemann,bop gnp,"Economics Minister Martin Bangemann, who flies to Washington this weekend for high level talks, said boosting West German economic growth would not have any significant effect on the high U.S. Current account deficit. In a paper prepared ahead of his trip, Bangemann said Bonn's trading partners had been asking whether West German growth was slowing and whether the Federal Republic should not in the future pursue more strongly expansionary policies. In the paper Bangemann wrote, ""It is not possible to reduce the U.S. Current account deficit by any signficant amount just through more stimulation of the West German economy."" One U.S. Administration policy maker said in Washington this week that the United States government wanted West Germany and Japan to reduce their interest rates even further to stimulate their economies. Bangemann said it was clear the high mark, as well as uncertainty about further currency developments, was making companies here cautious about production plans and investments. While West Germany did not seek exchange rates which unilaterally favoured its exports, it favoured more stability and realistic rates, which corresponded to ""fundamentals."" He welcomed the February ""Louvre Agreement"" of six industrial nations to stabilise currencies and said, ""(We) expect all parties to hold by the accords struck there."" West Germany had fulfilled its pledge of boosting planned tax cuts, he noted. Despite calls for lower interest rates, Bundesbank Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger has hinted that central bank policy may even have to be tightened. He wrote in a newspaper article published yesterday that the Bundesbank's current accommodative stance could not continue in the long term. During his trip to Washington, which runs from April 26 to 29, Bangemann will meet Secretary of State George Shultz, trade envoy Clayton Yeutter, World Bank President Barber Conable, IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus and Paul Volcker, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board."

baker says g-7 wants to halt dollar fall,money-fx dlr trade,"Treasury Secretary James Baker said the Group of Seven leading industrial nations is fully committed to halting a further decline in the dollar. ""Let me emphasize that all seven major industrial nations remain fully committed to strengthening policy coordination, promoting growth and cooperating to foster stability of exchange rates,"" he told the American Enterprise Institute. ""We all believe a further decline of the dollar could be counter productive to our efforts (to promote growth),"" he said. Baker also said that after meeting Japanese special envy Shintaro Abe, ""it's clear that Japan intends to take strong steps to stimulate its economy to meet its committments under the Louvre Accord."" Baker said in the past two years he has worked to promote greater coordination of economic policies and important progress has been made. ""Substantial exchange rate adjustments have also been accomplished over the past two years so that today we are better positioned to promote growth and reduce external imbalances,"" he said. Baker pointed out that in February the seven agreed to foster stable exchange rates and those commitments were renewed recently. In a speech largely devoted to discussing trade and competitiveness, Baker again warned of the dangers of protectionist trade legislation, saying it would harm the U.S. standard of living. Baker stressed adminstration trade policy sought to remove foreign barriers to trade and via forthcoming GATT talks will focus on agriculture, services and intellectual property. The Treasury Secretary said that as well as trade issues he had to focus on macroeconomic issues as well which encompass the trade picture. ""The world economy today is really one constantly flowing circle of capital and goods. Trade accounts catch and measure that flow at only one spot on the circle,"" he said."
spanish sunoil exporters seek seed clearance,oilseed sunseed veg-oil sun-oil,"Spanish exporters are asking the government to clear 33,200 tonnes of sunflower seed authorised for export by the European Community (EC), a spokesman for one of Spain's major sunflower oil producers said. He told Reuters in a telephone interview the government was holding back on authorisation to hold prices low. ""They are deliberately keeping prices down to help meet this year's inflation target despite the threat of a surplus on what looks like a bigger harvest than we expected,"" he said. He said the policy of allowing stocks to accumulate had caused a price drop, with raw oil prices falling to 147 pesetas a kilo from 160 at the start of the 1986/87 marketing year ending July 31. Sunflower oil output was expected to rise to 370,000 tonnes this year from 340,000 last year, with seed output up at 905,000 tonnes from 860,000 last year. He said domestic consumption was falling due to imports of other edible oils. ""We estimate demand at 296,000 tonnes this year, leaving a 124,000 tonne surplus with the 50,000 tonnes now stockpiled,"" he said. ""If we discount 24,000 tonnes held for strategic purposes, this still leaves us with 100,000 tonnes."""

shell oil first quarter net drops 61 pct,crude nat-gas gas pet-chem,"Shell Oil Co said first quarter net income dropped 61 pct over the prior-year quarter on revenues that slipped four pct. ""Lower prices for crude oil and natural gas and reduced margins in our oil and chemical products businesses were the major factor for the earings decline,"" John F. Bookout, president, said in a statement. For the quarter, the company, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD> <SC>, earned 108 mln dlrs on sales of 4.50 billion dlrs, compared with 276 mln dlrs on sales of 4.67 billion dlrs a year ago. Bookout said the company is cautiously optimistic oil markets will be less volatile in coming months than they were in 1986. ""In coming months, oil products results should benefit from seasonally higher gasoline volumes,"" he said. ""However, so long as U.S. product inventories remain high, it may be difficult to fully recover from the depressed margins of recent periods,"" he added. Bookout said the company's chemical products earnings should benefit from strong performances in chemical sales volumes and continued high industry operating rates. Shell said its oil and gas exploration and product segment earned 110 mln dlrs for the quarter vs 91 mln dlrs in 1986. It said earnings were hurt by lower selling prices for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Domestic crude oil prices averaged 14.24 dlrs a barrel, compared with 19.28 dlrs last year, while natural gas prices dropped 24 pct, Shell said. Shell said earnings at its oil products segment plunged by 53 mln dlrs, to eight mln dlrs. It said lower refined product selling prices were only partially offset by reduced raw material costs. The company said earnings from chemical products also fell sharply, to 40 mln dlrs from 72 mln dlrs, due mainly to lower margins, especially in commodity chemicals, coupled with its pullout from the agricultural chemicals business in October 1986. Shell said capital and exploratory outlays totaled 500 mln dlrs for the quarter, off from 645 mln dlrs."

In addition, Baker said he was opposed to the U.S. selling a yen denominated bond arguing that such a move might send the wrong signal to markets."
ugandan government proposes new taxes,money-fx bop coffee,"The Ugandan government, in its four year investment and development plan, proposed taxing land and food crops in an attempt to broaden its revenue base away from dependence on coffee sales. The government also said in the plan, made available to Reuters, that a devaluation of the Ugandan shilling would do little to redress a chronic balance of payments deficit. The plan, the first since President Yoweri Museveni took power 15 months ago, seeks to raise 2.4 billion dlrs in investment funds from abroad between 1987 and 1991. It says the government had already secured 1.4 billion dlrs in pledges before Islamic lenders promised a further 494 mln dlrs at a conference in Kampala last week. Uganda already had an external debt of 984 mln dlrs at the end of 1986 and in the nine months of the current budget debt servicing will cost 204 mln dlrs, almost 50 pct of export earnings of 431 mln, the plan said. The new fiscal measures include a proposed tax on large land holdings, regardless of whether the owners are exploiting them, and taxes on maize, beans and other crops sold by the Produce Marketing Board. The plan says the aim is to spread the tax burden, which in Uganda has traditionally fallen almost exclusively on coffee farmers. Coffee provides over 90 pct of foreign exchange earnings and more than 70 pct of government revenue. On exchange rate policy, it repeats Museveni's argument that any form of fotation would not help allocating resources. Western governments and multilateral funds say the Ugandan shilling is grossly overvalued and the government must change the exchange rate if it wishes to encourage investment. The shilling sells on the black market at more than 15,000 to the dollar, compared with an official rate of 1,400."
seaga presents growth budget for 1987,gnp jobs cpi,"prime minister edward seaga last night presented a budget of 6.9 billion jamaica dlrs, the largest in the country's history, which projects increases in capital spending and continued divestment of state companies. In a nationally televised speech to the parliament, the prime minister, who is also minister of finance, said jamaica's gdp grew by four pct, the highest level in 15 years, while unemployment stood at 23.6 pct, down from last year's 26 pct. Inflation, meanwhile, was 9.4 pct, as compared to 19.7 pct two years ago. Government revenues were up by 419 mln jamaica dlrs, to 4.3 billion, enough to finance the entire recurrent expenditure of 3.7 billion dlrs, with a 666 mln dlr surplus. Seaga said that with financial accounts in order, the government will proceed to reduce the country's debt service ratio from the current level of 49 pct of gdp to 25 pct over the next five years. During this period, he said, growth would be targetted at three to four pct. The 6.9 billion dlr budget, which represents an increase of 18 pct over last year's 5.8 billion, will be financed by borrowing of 8.868 billion dlrs and estmated revenue of 1.385 billion. Seaga said 1.835 billion of the budget will go to finance a government capital investment program. The plan, which represents a 10.3 pct increase over last year, projects greater spending on health, education, housing and infrastructure. Some 818 mln dlrs in revenue to finance the budget will come from the government's divestment program, which seaga said will be stepped up in 1987."

"soviet corn cargo rejected, reloading at chicago",ship grain corn,"A cargo of U.S. corn for the Soviet Union was rejected and forced to be unloaded at a Chicago export elevator earlier this week after it failed to make grade, with the British vessel Broompark now being reloaded, an elevator spokesman said. The first attempt to load the ship failed when the percentage of broken kernels proved to be higher than contract specifications, he said. The Soviets traditionally refuse to take sub-grade grain at a price discount, as is the practice with many other importing nations, he added. The official estimated the reloading of the vessel with about 700,000 tonnes of corn may be completed by Tuesday, April 28."
bank of finland eases reference rate restrictions,interest money-fx,"The Bank of Finland said it was reducing restrictions on the use of money market rates as reference rates for loans. The Bank would start quoting money market rates referred to as HELIBOR (Helsinki Interbank Offered Rate). Banks may henceforth use these as reference rates in their lending, it said. From May 1 the banks would be allowed, without special central bank approval, to use as a reference rate not only its base rate but also other Bank of Finland rates or the official money market rate used in market transactions. A derivative of these could also be used, the statement said. But housing loans would be excepted and their lending rate would, as formerly, be linked directly or indirectly to the Bank of Finland's base rate. The new guidelines involve mainly two changes. Money market rates in future would be used as reference rates for loans with a maturity of over five years and the introduction of a new reference rate would no longer require central bank approval. The decision was made as a continuation of the central bank's process of liberalisation, it said."

The March increase in the overall energy costs, including petroleum, coal and natural gas, followed a 3.0 pct rise in January and a 1.9 pct rise in February, it said. However, energy prices were 5.6 pct below year-ago levels. The department's Consumer Price Index showed that the cost of gasoline rose in March by 2.3 pct, after a 4.2 pct rise in February. Gasoline prices were nonetheless 5.9 pct below their levels as of March 1986. Also, the category including fuel oil, coal and bottled gas rose in March by 1.4 pct, putting it 9.0 pct under the year-ago figure. The index also showed that natural gas and electricity were unchanged last month, but down 3.1 pct from the March 1986 figure, the department said. The index has been updated to reflect 1982-84 consumption patterns. Previously, the index was based on 1972-73 patterns."

soviets say 1987 economic results unsatisfactory,ipi trade,"The Soviet government said economic results achieved in the first three months of the year were unsatisfactory, the official news agency Tass said. Soviet industrial production from January to March grew by 2.5 per cent compared with the same period last year, but fell short of its target by 0.8 percent, official statistics showed. ""The Council of Ministers (government) emphasised that the results did not meet the Communist Party's exacting demands for the radical reconstruction of the economy,"" Tass said. ""The first quarter economic results were deemed unsatisfactory."" The government said poor economic results last January, when industrial production was 0.1 lower than in January 1986, had been overcome to a considerable extent in March, but the negative effects had not been completely eliminated. It singled out failings in the engineering, chemical and timber industries, as well as light industry. Growth in the machine-building sector, a priority in Kremlin plans for economic renewal, also fell short of target by 4.2 per cent, with below-level output in nearly all branches at a cost of 723 million roubles (1.08 billion dollars) in undelivered products. The sales volume of consumer goods fell 2.7 per cent short of planned growth, with a resulting decline in income to the state, the figures showed. Foreign trade turnover totalled 27.5 billion roubles (41.25 billion dollars), or 4.8 billion roubles (7.2 billion dollars) less than in the same period last year. The power industry, however, performed well. Output of oil, electricity, gas and coal were all above plan."
barclays says prospects bright for uk economy,gnp interest,"Britain can look forward to fairly strong economic growth, falling interest rates and firm Sterling, Barclays Bank Plc chairman-elect John Quinton said. ""We should see a reasonable decline in interest rates in the next few months, but not a great one and not a rapid one,"" Quinton told a press luncheon. He said that whereas the British economy is growing at about three pct, he expects only ""minor"" growth for the western industrialized world as a whole. But, unless there is a major move toward protectionism, there should be no need to worry about a recession in the next two or three years. Quinton said much will depend on the resolution of trade disputed between the United States and Japan. He said Tokyo, in resisting the appreciation of the yen, had been ""holding back the laws of economics."" But if the dollar has to fall further to reduce Japan's trade surplus, he said he hoped the fall would be slow rather than rapid. Quinton said it will be difficult for the City of London to stave off the creation of a powerful securities industry regulatory body along the lines of the Securities and Exchange Commission in the U.S., especially if there are more insider trading scandals and if the Labour Party wins the next U.K. election."
usda reports seen negative to livestock futures,livestock f-cattle pork-belly l-cattle carcass,"Commission house livestock analysts agreed with Chicago Mercantile Exchange floor traders in calling today's USDA 13-state quarterly cattle on feed report and cold storage report for pork bellies negative. June live cattle futures are called 0.20 to 0.50 cent lower on Monday and back months of cattle are expected 0.50 to 1.00 cent lower. Pork bellies are expected 0.50 to 1.00 cent or more lower, the analysts said. Disappointment was voiced over the placement and total on feed figures in the cattle report. Both the quarterly section and monthly 7-state part showed the amount placed on feed and on feed numbers at the high end of expectations. The other disappearance figure of only three pct above a year ago in the 7-state section was also vieved as negative. Most of the early guesses predicted a much larger number for death loss following the two winter snow storms that struck the west in late March, they said. However, weight groupings were friendly to the nearby futures and should prompt some bull spreading on the decline, they said. William Arndt from Dean Witter noted that the 900 to 1,100 lb steers and 700 to 900 lb heifers were at 94 pct of a year ago and should lend some support to June futures. However, 700 to 900 lb steers at 119 pct will weigh on August, he said. ""The big reduction in cattle weighing over 900 lbs should be friendly to the market for at least the next 30 to 60 days,"" AGE Clearing analyst Jerry Abbenhaus said. Movement of bellies into frozen storage was at the high end of expectations and should weigh on futures tomorrow, especially as futures prices ended weak today, they said. Other parts of the cold storage report were also viewed as negative to livestock and meat futures. ""We have a lot of poultry in storage. Even though we have smaller pork supplies, the decline is not enough to offset the increases in poultry,"" Shearson Lehman analyst Chuck Levitt said. Also, there is more beef in storage than last year and this was achieved on smaller production."
usda seeking comments on 1988 farm programs,grain wheat rice cotton,"The U.S. Agriculture Department is seeking comments on common provisions of the 1988 wheat, feedgrains, cotton and rice programs. It said many program provisions are common to all the commodity programs and decisions made in regard to one will likely apply to other program crops. It asked for specific comments on the percentage reduction for acreage limitation requirements under the wheat program, the loan and purchase level, and whether a marketing loan, the inventory reduction program and related provisions should be implemented. The percentage acreage reduction of between 20 and 30 pct must be announced no later than June 1, 1987 for wheat, it said."
usda adjusts louisiana gulf price differentials,grain corn,"The U.S. Agriculture Department has narrowed by three cents the price differential between the Louisiana Gulf price of corn and posted country prices pegged to the gulf price, USDA officials said. The change, effective April 27, means posted county prices will be three cents higher in the region, Robert Sindt, assistant deputy administrator of USDA's Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, said. Trade sources said USDA adjusted the differentials because gulf prices had shown some weakness in recent days compared with the rest of the country. Sindt said Louisiana Gulf corn price differentials that had been between four and eight cents would, effective Monday, range between one and five cents. Trade sources said cash bids at the Louisiana Gulf have been between three and 4.5 cents weaker than in the rest of the country in recent days, and that USDA's move would strengthen the front end of the corn market."
oecd warns sweden on labour costs,gnp cpi jobs,"High labour costs and slower corporate investment could hinder Sweden's economic growth after 1987, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, said. The Swedish economy grew at a slower rate in 1986 than in previous years. GDP rose about 1.7 pct in 1986 compared with 2.2 pct in 1985. But this growth depended largely on external factors, particularly lower oil prices, the OECD secretariat said in its latest annual report on Sweden. It warned that labour costs had risen more rapidly in Sweden than in other OECD countries. Because of high labour costs Swedish industry, which largely relies upon export markets, was losing market share. Wages in the manufacturing sector grew by seven pct in 1986, in line with 1985 increases, while public sector wages rose an estimated 9.2 pct in 1986, up from six pct in 1985. This was significantly higher than average wage increases of 3.75 pct for the seven largest members of the OECD in 1986. The report said wage moderation was central to maintaining economic growth in Sweden. It suggested that wage negotiations should be at least partly centralised to control the total wages bill and hold down inflation and unemployment levels. Helped by low oil prices and the government's tight fiscal policy, inflation fell to just over three pct in 1986 from almost six pct in 1985 but remained higher than in most other OECD countries, the report said. Unemployment, a principal policy target, was at 2.7 pct in 1986, in line with 1985's 2.8 pct and well below the OECD average of 8.6 pct. The report said Sweden's employment policies accounted for the high levels of wage inflation. It also said that economic growth in 1986 relied increasingly on private consumption because corporate investment in machinery and equipment had shrunk. The total volume of industrial investments dropped by two pct in 1986, with sharp declines in spending by the wood, pulp and paper industries. This compared to a 19 pct rise in 1985 when there was heavy investment in these industries. The OECD said Sweden should now make an effort to boost corporate investments and reduce its dependence on domestic consumption for economic growth. It suggested there was room for reform in the tax system. Sweden should continue to cut public sector spending, especially in local government, to keep in line with its tighter fiscal policy, the report said."
ecuador economy seen contracting in 1987,gnp crude trade bop,"The Ecuadorean economy, struck by an earthquake last month, will contract an estimated four pct in 1987 and its crude oil output will drop by 42 pct, the government's national development council (Conade) said. A Conade report, dated April 21 and obtained, said that the country's gross domestic product (gdp) would fall by an estimated four pct compared to 1.5 pct growth last year. Conade functions as the country's main planning institution. Crude output will fall to 61.2 mln barrels in 1987 from 105.6 mln in 1986, Conade said. It forecast exports of 22.9 mln of crude and derivatives against 63.3 mln last year. The March five earthquake killed up to 1,000 people and caused an estimated one billion dlrs in damage. It paralyzed Ecuador's crude output because it ruptured the country's main pipeline from Lago Agrio, at the heart of jungle oilfields, to the Pacific Ocean port of Balao. It will take until at least end-July to repair the line and return output to normal levels, oil officials said. Ecuador output was about 250,000 barrels per day before the tremor. Conade forecast total 1987 exports of 1.77 billion dlrs, 572 mln dlrs of which would be oil and derivatives. Imports were forecast at 1.70 billion dlrs. Total 1986 exports were 2.18 billion dlrs, of which 979 mln dlrs were crude and derivatives, with total imports 1.66 billion dlrs. Conade predicted that payments on Ecuador's 8.16 billion dlrs foreign debt will be limited to 947 mln dlrs this year against 1.489 billion dlrs last year. Conade's projected ceiling on payments is not legally binding. The current account balance of payments deficit was seen at 934 mln dlrs in 1987. It was 696 mln dlrs in 1986."
bundesbank aims for tight money policy - schlesinger,money-supply cpi,"The Bundesbank is trying to keep monetary policy tight in order to counter inflationary tendencies, Bundesbank Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger was quoted as saying. ""We are trying to keep the monetary framework tight, so that inflationary pressures cannot develop,"" he told the Frankfurter Neue Presse daily in an interview. ""Central bank money stock does not have to be reduced because of this, but it must continue to grow modestly,"" he said. Bundesbank spokesmen were not available for comment. On Thursday Schlesinger said in a contribution to the Handelsblatt daily that the accommodative monetary stance in West Germany caused by outside pressures could not determine policy in the long term. The improvement in West German terms of trade, providing room for non-inflationary expansion of domestic demand in excess of output growth, put the overshoot of central bank money stock in a more positive light, he said on Thursday. Central bank money stock, the Bundesbank's main monetary measure, was growing at an annual rate of 7.3 pct in March, above the 1987 three-six pct target range. Money stock overshot the 3.5-5.5 pct 1986 growth target. Schlesinger told the Frankfurter Neue Presse that the phase of falling prices was over in West Germany. Prices might still be lower on a comparison with their level one year earlier. But the cost of living index has risen to 120.7 in March from its November 1986 low of 120.0, expressing a slight rise in prices, Schlesinger said. In March the cost of living was steady against February but 0.2 pct below March 1986. Schlesinger said a rise of between one and 1.5 pct during 1987 would be acceptable, and effectively mean price stability. Agreements so far in the current West German wage round are neutral as far as inflation is concerned because of the strength of the mark, Schlesinger said. Wage agreements in the public service and engineering industry were relatively high in view of the stable cost of living. But the higher costs would be compensated for, he said. ""I am thinking above all of the fact that in the course of this year we will in all probability have a stronger mark against other currencies than last year,"" he said, adding ""Without this mark revaluation effect, we would have had to say that the wage rise agreements were not neutral for prices."" Schlesinger said exchange rate movements had increased the scope for redistributing wealth this year, but this development was unlikely to continue in 1988. ""For this reason I cannot comment on that part of the engineering agreement which covers the coming years,"" he said. Some 2.3 mln workers for the public services received a 3.4 pct pay rise from January 1. An agreement for four mln engineering workers raised pay by 3.7 pct from April 1, and then raises pay by another two pct from April 1, 1988 and by 2.5 pct from April 1, 1989. The engineering agreement also cuts the working week by 1-1/2 hours to 37 hours in two stages."
top nations agree over farm trade issue,trade grain wheat,"Ministers from the major trading nations have for the first time made a concerted commitment to review the whole distorted structure of world farm trade, Canadian Trade Minister Patricia Carney said. ""We think we can get some movement on this,"" she told reporters at a briefing following informal talks with the U.S., Japanese and European Community (EC) trade ministers here. Canada, strongly supported by Australia, has championed the cause of both developed and developing nations which have seen their farm trade suffer largely due to a farm subsidy war between the United States and the EC. Japan""s protected agricultural markets have also attracted criticism. The issue is of extreme importance to many indebted, developing nations which often rely totally on one or two farm sector exports to sustain their economies but which cannot compete with the subsidised U.S. And EC products. ""Canada can afford so many billions of dollars (to do so), but many countries cannot,"" said Carney. She said the EC had changed its previous unhelpful attitude and had raised proposals similar to those of Canada under which to discuss the issue. Talks will now continue at the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which meets next month, and at the series of discussions on a new world trading framework, begun at Punta del Este, Uruguay, last year. Carney said Japan had also agreed to take a positive role in the farm talks, and that the United States was willing to see short-term progress, as long as long-term solutions were not affected. Canada""s five point programme demands that farm product prices must reflect open world market prices, that any support for farmers incomes should not be linked to production incentives, that there should be no new farm subsidies, no new farm import barriers, and that any decisions should be implemented collectively. The farm trade problem was almost completely ignored by the industrialised world until Canada raised it last year at the Tokyo summit of seven leading industrial powers. The distortions created by subsidies and protectionism have created some absurd situations. For example, to protect its farmers the Japanese government buys Canadian wheat and sells it at 10 times the purchase price to Japanese consumers. ""So we end up borrowing in the Japanese (financial) market to help pay subsidies to keep our farmers while they make a profit on our wheat to help pay the price support for their farmers,"" said Carney. The problem causes pain for many nations and increases the already dangerously high debts that they owe mainly to U.S., Japanese and EC banks."
u.s. central banker opposes further dollar fall,money-fx dlr interest,"New York Federal Reserve Bank President Gerald Corrigan opposed a further fall in the value of the dollar but refused to say whether U.S. Interest rates would be raised to protect the currency. ""A further decline in the dollar or appreciation of the yen at this juncture I would regard as counterproductive,"" he told a news conference. His comments echoed those made last week by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker, who also warned against a further dollar fall. The U.S. Currency plunged to a post-war low below 140 yen last week, despite dollar-buying by a number of central banks. Currency speculators and investors are convinced that a further dollar fall is needed to help reduce the huge U.S. Trade deficit, dealers said. The only thing likely to help the dollar is seen as a rise in U.S. Interest rates. Corrigan refused to say whether the U.S. Was ready to risk damaging its economic recovery by raising interest rates. The dollar""s sharp drop this month has also raised questions about the usefulness of recent meetings of the Group of Seven. But Corrigan said: ""They have played a constructive role in so far as the broad objective of facilitating a higher degree of economic policy coordination."""
trade ministers say governments need credibility,trade money-fx dlr,"Four trade ministers ended a weekend meeting with a frank confession that their governments are losing credibility in world financial markets and will not regain it until they back their promises over trade and currencies with action. ""Until today we have anounced policies, but when it came to action required it was done in a way that satisfied nobody,"" Japanese Trade Minister Hajime Tamura told a news conference. ""From now on, if a government comes up with a certain policy, it must be followed by action,"" he said following two days of informal talks with the trade ministers of the United States, the European Community and Canada in central Japan. Last week, the dollar fell to a new record low below 140 yen, despite statements from the Group of Seven (G-7) leading industrial powers that currencies should be stabilised to underpin world trade. ""We need credibility to gain confidence. When we have confidence, then we can have an impact,"" said Tamura. His colleagues agreed that when major trade nations fought over trade issues while calling for each other to honour free trade rules in general, it was not a sight which inspired confidence in the markets. ""The time has come now to act in step with the talk. If you belong to a club, you have to act in concord with the rules, if you want to be credible,"" said EC external trade chief Willy de Clercq. Canadian Trade Minister Patricia Carney also agreed: ""We are meeting in a time of great trade tension. What the world needs to see is that we have the political will to deal with these problems we face."" She said that next month""s meeting of the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development and the meeting of leaders of the G-7 nations in Venice in the summer would be a forum to show this will existed. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter reminded the news conference that the results of such high level meetings could lead to action which would only have an effect on smoothing out world trade imbalances perhaps years later. ""The media typically has a tendency to evaluate meetings like this in terms of tangible results. That is not the way it should be pursued,"" he said. ""What is achieved in an intangible way almost always exceeds what is achieved in a tangible way,"" he said. Progress in personal contacts and understanding each others"" positions and policies was just as important toward reducing trade tensions, he said. Tamura read out an agreed summary of the joint talks: Currency stability was now essential, but currency movements alone would not correct a U.S. Trade deficit with Japan which hit 58 billion dlrs last year, an 18 billion dlr EC deficit with Japan in 1986, and a Japanese global trade surplus of almost 90 billion, he said. Trade retaliation, protectionism, and forcible export restraints which lead to a shrinkage in world trade flows were most dangerous, he said. The imbalances can only be solved by coordinated policies over a whole range of fiscal, monetary, trade and industrial measures, and in line with a body of internationally agreed rules, he said. In this regard, the policing role of the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade world trade body must be strengthened, he said. The ministers reconfirmed their individual promises to solve the problem. The United States will try to reduce its large budget deficit and restore competitiveness within its industries. Japan will introduce early and effective measures to expand its domestic growth and rely less on exports. The EC must continue efforts for balanced growth and reduced unemployment. All felt satisfied at the new progress in the Canadian economy."

The meeting will provide senior government officials with their first chance to discuss the recent sharp drop of the dollar, although the main focus of the gathering is longer term, they said. Deputy Finance Ministers, including Japanese Vice-Finance Minister Toyoo Gyohten, will attend. The meeting will be held in Italy, they said, but gave no other details. The leaders of the G-7, the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan and West Germany, are expected to discuss ways of improving economic policy coordination in Venice. The hope is that increased coordination will help reduce the huge imbalances in world trade and calm volatile currency markets. But economists say the strategy has so far not worked. Japanese officials admitted there is little more they can do on their own to stem the dollar decline, which last week saw the currency plunge to a post-war low below 140 yen. The officials said they expected sentiment against the dollar to change soon, once the U.S. Trade deficit starts to fall and the Japanese surplus begins to shrink. ""We have already seen some signs of improvement (in the trade picture), but the market does not appreciate it yet,"" one said. Last week""s passage of the Japanese government budget by parliament""s Lower House also paves the way for Tokyo to take additional action to stimulate its sagging economy and boost imports, the officials said."

"german trade surplus should narrow, bundesbank says",bop trade,"Germany's current account and trade surpluses should narrow sharply in 1987 but they will take a long time to get back to normal levels, the Bundesbank said in its 1986 yearly report. The procedure would be slow as an abrupt turnaround in external factors such as oil prices and exchange rates was not expected. It did not specify what levels it considered normal. West Germany posted a record trade surplus of 124 billion marks in 1986, after 86 billion in 1985 and its current account surplus widened to 76.50 billion from 44.6 billion. Signs imports would continue to rise, a factor already noted at the start of 1986, while exports rose only slightly, would lead to a smaller trade surplus, the Bundesbank said. In real terms, West German imports rose 5.7 pct in 1986 while exports only increased by 0.8 pct. Germany's current account surplus widened to a provisional 6.6 billion in February from 4.8 billion in January but was down from 6.85 billion posted in February 1986.

Drought has hit another 189,000 hectares, with 40,000 hectares very badly affected, it said. Insecticides are in short supply so only the most endangered rice fields should be sprayed, the radio added. The affected areas -- the Red River delta and other coastal areas in northern Vietnam -- produce between 30 to 40 per cent of the country's rice. The radio report, monitored in Bangkok on April 20 but only translated here over the weekend, said the threatened damage was spread over twice as large an area as last year. Vietnam has not been able to grow enough food for its expanding population, with the Soviet Union buying rice in Thailand and Burma in recent years for supply to Vietnam. Vietnam produced 18.2 million tonnes of food, most of it rice, last year and hopes to boost that to 23-24 million tonnes by 1990."

thailand to seek clarification on u.s. rice prices,grain rice,"Thailand will this week seek clarification from the U.S. About its decision to freeze rice export prices from January to early April, Commerce Minister Montri Pongpanich said. Montri told reporters he will seek a meeting with U.S. Ambassador William Brown to determine why the U.S. Failed to set its weekly rice prices in accordance with rising world prices during the period. He said the U.S. Has followed a policy of weakening world rice prices by announcing highly subsidised export prices lower than those quoted by Thai traders. Thai officials said weekly rice prices as announced by the U.S. Agriculture Department were unchanged for 11 weeks up to April 8. Thailand, a major rice exporter, has criticised the U.S. Farm Act which provides heavy subsidies to U.S. Exporters enabling them to compete with Thai exporters. Thai officials said average export prices of Thai rice fell 19 pct last year and another 5.8 pct during the first quarter this year. The Board of Trade said Thailand exported 1.23 mln tonnes in January/March, down from 1.29 mln a year ago. It said the export decline was partly due to the reluctance of Thai traders to accept all foreign orders as world prices did not rise in line with firming domestic prices. The board said, however, that Thailand may export more rice later this year, especially to Africa, the Middle East and Asia, due to lower production in many drought affected African countries and to expected small exportable surpluses in Burma and Pakistan. It said Thai rice exports to nine major African buyers rose to 351,889 tonnes during the first quarter from 93,038 a year earlier."

The leaders of the G-7, the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan and West Germany, are expected to discuss ways of improving economic policy coordination in Venice. The hope is that increased coordination will help reduce the huge imbalances in world trade and calm volatile currency markets. But economists say the strategy has so far not worked. Japanese officials admitted there is little more they can do on their own to stem the dollar decline, which last week saw the currency plunge to a post-war low below 140 yen. The officials said they expected sentiment against the dollar to change soon, once the U.S. Trade deficit starts to fall and the Japanese surplus begins to shrink. ""We have already seen some signs of improvement (in the trade picture), but the market does not appreciate it yet,"" one said. Last week's passage of the Japanese government budget by parliament's Lower House also paves the way for Tokyo to take additional action to stimulate its sagging economy and boost imports, the officials said."

Azpurua told reporters he will be accompanied by Central Bank President Hernan Anzola and Director of Public Finance Jorge Marcano. 'The idea is to hold meetings with Japanese economic and financial authorities, with the banks which have business and credits in Venezuela and with some of the Japanese companies already active here,' Azpurua said."
balladur urges adherence to g-7 currency accords,money-fx dlr lit,"French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the Group of Seven major industrial nations, G-7, can achieve stable currency values by adhering to accords reached this year in Paris and Washington. Balladur, asked at a news conference if coordinated market intervention by central banks was sufficient to halt the dollar's recent slide, said ""each country has to fulfill commitments"" outlined in the G-7 accords. Earlier this month in Washington, finance ministers of the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Italy, Britain and Canada reaffirmed an earlier Paris accord to arrest the dollar's fall. Balladur said the current nervousness in foreign exchange markets can be partly attributed to ""some operators in the market only watching short term economic indicators. You have to keep a cool head,"" he said, declining to elaborate further. In an earlier speech before the Milan Chamber of Commerce, the minister said European countries have to seek ""a better consensus of economic and monetary policies."" On the European Monetary System, he said, ""The persistent vulnerability of the foreign currency mechanism, particularly to the movements of the dollar, can be explained by the absence of a common policy for currencies of other countries."" Balladur said, ""I am profoundly convinced that the European countries have to define together this position with respect to the dollar and the yen."" He said Italy eventually would have to abandon its higher margin of fluctuation within the European Montetary System. ""I hope that the spectacular improvement of the economic situation and of the balance of payments will permit (Italy) to do it soon."" The lira is currently allowed a fluctuation margin either side of its agreed midpoints with other EMS currencies of six pct, against 2.25 pct permitted for the other members."
u.s. treasury's baker cancels trip to australia,money-fx trade,"Treasury Secretary James Baker has cancelled a trip to Australia because of pressing business at home, including the visit this week by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, a Treasury spokesman said. The spokesman, who asked not to be identified, said: ""I would not draw any conclusion from the cancellation...I would just say it's the press of business."" But he added that the visit by the Japanese leader was ""part of the press of business."" The spokesman denied the cancellation was linked to the current turmoil in the financial markets. Nakasone's visit is expected to be crucial for the currency markets. Unless the Japanese prime minister brings with him measures to stimulate the Japanese economy by fiscal expansion or lower interest rates, the visit is likely to be considered by currency markets as an outright failure. In addition, it is thought highly unlikely that Nakasone and Reagan will agree on the removal of U.S. trade sanctions imposed earlier this month on certain electronic goods. But the participation in the talks by Baker, the administration's top policy maker on international economic affairs, suggests that hard bargaining between the two sides may be in prospect. Asked if the trip by Baker, who was to have left April 30 and returned May 6, had been dropped in the last couple of days, the Treasury spokesman replied: ""I would think so."" He described the trip as ""purely ceremonial."" Both Japan and the United States have a lot to lose from an unsuccessful outcome to the this week's talks. Tokyo and Washington are aware that nervous currency markets stand ready to bail out of dollars and buy yen, which economists fear could send world interest rates soaring and even lead to global recession. Baker has been the driving force behind the administration's efforts to coordinate international economic policies and reduce global trade imbalances."

trade ministers say governments need credibility,trade money-fx,"Four trade ministers ended a weekend meeting with a frank confession that their governments are losing credibility in world financial markets and will not regain it until they back their promises over trade and currencies with action. ""Until today we have anounced policies, but when it came to action required it was done in a way that satisfied nobody,"" Japanese Trade Minister Hajime Tamura told a news conference. ""From now on, if a government comes up with a certain policy, it must be followed by action,"" he said following two days of informal talks with the trade ministers of the United States, the European Community and Canada in central Japan. Last week, the dollar fell to a new record low below 140 yen, despite statements from the Group of Seven (G-7) leading industrial powers that currencies should be stabilised to underpin world trade. ""We need credibility to gain confidence. When we have confidence, then we can have an impact,"" said Tamura. His colleagues agreed that when major trade nations fought over trade issues while calling for each other to honour free trade rules in general, it was not a sight which inspired confidence in the markets. ""The time has come now to act in step with the talk. If you belong to a club, you have to act in concord with the rules, if you want to be credible,"" said EC external trade chief Willy de Clercq. Pat Carney of Canada said ""We are meeting in a time of great trade tension. What the world needs to see is that we have the political will to deal with these problems we face."" She said that next month's meeting of the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development and the meeting of leaders of the G-7 nations in Venice in the summer would be a forum to show this will existed. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter reminded the news conference that the results of such high level meetings could lead to action which would only have an effect on smoothing out world trade imbalances perhaps years later. ""The media typically has a tendency to evaluate meetings like this in terms of tangible results. That is not the way it should be pursued,"" he said. ""What is achieved in an intangible way almost always exceeds what is achieved in a tangible way,"" he said. Progress in personal contacts and understanding each others' positions and policies was just as important toward reducing trade tensions, he said. Tamura read out an agreed summary of the joint talks: Currency stability was now essential, but currency movements alone would not correct a U.S. trade deficit with Japan which hit 58 billion dlrs last year, an 18 billion dlr EC deficit with Japan in 1986, and a Japanese global trade surplus of almost 90 billion, he said. Trade retaliation, protectionism, and forcible export restraints which lead to a shrinkage in world trade flows were most dangerous, he said. The imbalances can only be solved by coordinated policies over a whole range of fiscal, monetary, trade and industrial measures, and in line with a body of internationally agreed rules, he said. In this regard, the policing role of the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade world trade body must be strengthened, he said. The ministers reconfirmed their individual promises to solve the problem. The United States will try to reduce its large budget deficit and restore competitiveness within its industries. Japan will introduce early and effective measures to expand its domestic growth and rely less on exports. The EC must continue efforts for balanced growth and reduced unemployment. All felt satisfied at the new progress in the Canadian economy."

They said the bank bought dollars against guilders as the U.S. Currency dipped to a low of 2.0013 guilders from 2.0130-40 on opening, the lowest since the end of January. There was no intervention at the fix, however, which put the dollar at 2.0045 guilders after 2.0280 last Friday, and dealers said the Bank's buying was limited. ""I'd be surprised if the Bank had bought as much as 100 mln dlrs,"" one dealer said."
seoul unveils shopping list of u.s. goods,trade alum zinc pet-chem iron-steel grain wheat corn cotton oilseed soybean,"South Korea unveiled a shopping list of 2.6 billion dlrs of U.S. Goods in line with its new policy of seeking to limiting its trade surplus to ease trade friction with Washington. The government said this would help freeze this year's trade surplus with the United States at the 1986 level. ""The surplus, which rose to 7.4 billion dollars last year from 4.3 billion in 1985, was projected to top 10 billion this year but the government has taken steps to constrain it to the seven billion dollar level,"" one Trade Ministry official told Reuters. A government statement said the 2.6 billion dlrs was in addition to about two billion dlrs of purchases made last month by a South Korean trade mission to the United States. The announcement follows a visit here this week by U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige, who said that if South Korea wanted to avoid protectionist retaliation it should not falter in its policies to open its market and cut its surplus. The statement said the government, state agencies and other public institutions would buy 480 mln dlrs worth of U.S. Cars, computers, helicopters, ambulances, motorcycles, medical and laboratory equipment and other products. ""This amounts includes 89 mln dlrs worth of purchases which were not originally reflected in their budgets,"" it added. The list includes 1.13 billion dlrs of capital goods, 700 mln of farm products, 50 mln of aluminium, zinc, polyethylene and other raw materials, and 250 mln of steel, electronics and shipbuilding parts which would be shifted from other nations. Agriculture Ministry officials said South Korea had already bought 310 mln dlrs worth of U.S. Wheat, raw cotton, corn and soybeans. This meant the country would buy from the United States nearly all of the 1.27 billion dlrs of its planned imports of such commodities this year, they said. The government will also take steps to reduce tariffs, accelerate the opening of its markets, voluntarily restrain exports and cut export financing, the statement said. South Korea will also reorganise the country's 3,600 trade agents to deliver better after-sales services for imported products and hold a trade show in November for U.S. Products."

banker sees currency falling to balance trade,money-fx trade,"A leading regional banker said that it was axiomatic that despite market intervention, a country's currency will eventually fall to an exchange rate which balances its international trade and payments accounts. John Medlin, president and chief executive officer for the First Wachovia Corp, said that ""substantial and rapid currency devaluations usually are followed in time by surging price inflation, spiralling interest rates and painful economic austerity."" Speaking to a banking trade group, he also said the peak of debt writeoff has not yet been reached. Medlin told the Bankers Association for Foreign Trade that ultimately ""our nation's budget and trade deficits will be balanced either through voluntary restraints in spending and consumption or through forced austerity imposed by a dispassionate and unmerciful international market place."" He said the continuing weakness of the dollar and the recent increase in inflation and interest rates ""provide early warning that the classic laws of international economics still are in effect."" He also told the association that trying to reduce the trade deficit by erecting protectionist barriers to imports would not give lasting relief. ""However, the imposition and enforcement of fair trade rules could help improve imbalances with nations which practice protectionism and deception on us."" Medlin noted that the U.S. economy was likely to continue ""at best being a sluggish mixture of depressed segments and growth areas."" But he said that the business cycle was still alive and that the next downturn ""could be deeper and harder to reverse than the last one."""

pressure grows for u.s. action to aid dollar,dlr money-fx interest,"Pressure is growing in the financial markets for the U.S. to take overt action to stabilize the dollar even though doubts linger that it has fallen far enough to help redress world trade imbalances, economists and dealers said. Some experts believe that a half-point increase in the U.S. discount rate, preferably in conjunction with rate cuts in Tokyo and Bonn, would be enough to discourage sellers. But many fear that more drastic action, such as a U.S. issue of yen-denominated Treasury bonds, may be needed. Despite official warnings about the dangers of a further dollar decline and concerted central bank intervention, the dollar extended its recent sharp depreciation, touching a 40-year low of 137.25 yen in Tokyo earlier today after closing here on Friday at 139.30/40. The impact on other financial markets was devastating. In Tokyo, the stock market suffered its largest single day decline; in London, gold bullion prices rose to four-year highs and in the U.S., long Treasury bond yields surged above 8.80 pct and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 40 points in hectic early trading. ""The problem now is linkage. This is not just a currency problem. It is affecting all the markets,"" said one senior trader at a major U.S. bank. Up until September of last year, international efforts to redress world trade imbalances appeared to working like a dream; the dollar was falling in an orderly manner, world interest rates were tumbling and inflation was kept in check. In recent months, however, this strategy has begun to show signs of severe stress, with the U.S. imposition of punitive tariffs on Japan threatening to unravel this spirit of cooperating and condemn the world to a damaging trade war. ""The markets fear that we have built up a momentum that is really difficult to stop. A U.S. rate hike has become an inevitability,"" one currency dealer said. ""At this point, nothing short of a Fed discount rate increase, ideally combined with further discount rate cuts by Japan and Germany, would seem capable of stabilizing the dollar,"" said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc. Allen Sinai of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc predicted a 1/4 to 1/2 point U.S. rate increase before May 19 and a rise in U.S. bank prime lending rates to eight pct from 7-3/4 pct in the near future. But many economists feared that any moderate U.S. rate increases, which appear unlikely to be matched by rate cuts overseas, would be too little, too late. ""They should have done this 10 days ago. It would have done the trick then,"" said one currency analyst. ""If they do it now, it would be seen as a defensive measure not an offensive one. It would show policy weakness not strength,"" added one trader. In addition, economists fear that a discount rate rise might place additional strain on a sluggish U.S. economy and tempt embattled debtor nations to retaliate. A U.S. discount rate increase would also fuel the protectionist fires in Washington, where the House is expected to pass a protectionist trade bill, whatever compromises President Reagan and Prime Minister Nakasone can come up with during their summit later in the week. ""Politically, they can't really do it this week,"" said one currency analyst, pointing out that if it failed to stabilize the dollar, it would only weaken the U.S. negotiating stance. Even if the U.S. retains the upper hand, economists and traders do not hold out high hopes for any major new initiatives from this week's talks. At best, the experts see some sort of accord whereby Japan will agree to stimulate growth and open its domestic markets to outsiders while the U.S. promises to lift its tariffs and support the Group of Seven dollar stabilization agreement. But many fear that this may not be enough to assuage the market's speculative selling fervor, which has now raised fears of weak overseas interest at next week's quarterly U.S. Treasury refunding program. Japanese and European investors have traditionally played an active role in these auctions, which are expected to total 28 to 29 billion dlrs. Consequently, thoughts are turning to the possibility that President Reagan may try to remove foreign investors' worries about currency risk by financing part of the U.S. budget deficit in yen or mark bonds, rather than dollars. While similar action by former President Carter helped to stabilize the dollar in 1978, the White House is clearly reluctant to take such a step, economists said. This hesitance was amply shown last Friday when U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said, ""there might well be some who would view (yen-denominated bonds) as a lack of confidence by the U.S. in its own currency."" Baker added, ""therefore we don't think it's an appropriate thing to do."" A foreign exchange analyst at a major Japanese bank here shared Baker's doubts. ""Dollar defending measures are very unlikely. They will confirm the dollar's weak undertone and lead to further speculative dollar selling,"" he said. Thus, it may be less destabilizing for the authorities to stop trying to fight the market's bearish sentiment. In a recent lengthy report, economists at Morgan Guaranty Trust Co concluded, ""the dollar should be left free to trade at whatever level market forces produce."""

He said the adjusted differentials supersede the adjustments made March 30. They represent an increase over the original differentials but are lower than the differential adjustments recently made. For differentials of five to 15 cents, CCC added one cent. For 16-25 cents add two cents, for 26-35 cts add three cts, for 36-45 cts add four cts and for 46-55 cts add five cts.

soy plants might be used to draw cadmium from soil,oilseed soybean strategic-metal,"Effective extraction of the toxic metal cadmium from soil may at last be feasible using soybean plants, research in the Netherlands by a Belgian-based environment group shows. Cadmium, naturally drawn up by plants and passed on to consumers, has been shown to produce kidney damage and resulting calcium loss as well as causing high blood pressure and cancers, a spokesman for the Ecological Life and Cultivation (VELT) said. Three years of experiments by the organization showed soybean plants extracted up to 16 pct of soil-borne cadmium, which went into the leaves and not into the beans themselves. Cadmium is present in the soil because of emissions in the past by factories producing non-ferrous metals, the spokesman said. ""Although many of these factories are now using far safer methods of manufacture, the cadmium is already in the soil and until now there has been no way to get rid of it,"" he said."

Small grains should be seeded across the Province in one to two weeks, assuming weather remains dry. Planting progress was most advanced in the southeast, with 30 pct of the spring wheat acres and 40 pct of the barley acres seeded. Cereals plantings were well under way in the south central part of the province, with seedings spotty so far in the southwest. Summer fallow acres should be in line with the latest Statistics Canada projections, the report said."
uk not considering restricting oil output,crude nat-gas,"Britain is not considering any restriction of its present oil production, UK Energy Minister Alick Buchanan-Smith said. Speaking to reporters at the Offshore Technology Conference, Buchanan-Smith said, ""No, we've made that absolutely clear, we see no reason for changing (the production level)."" Earlier today, Buchanan-Smith gave the go-ahead to Mobil Corp for two new North Sea developments -- the Ness oil field and Beryl B subsea water injection project -- totalling 96 mln dlrs (60 mln British pounds). Unlike Norway, which has restricted its production of North Sea oil by 80,000 barrels a day in an effort to stabilize world oil prices, Britain has consistently refused to intervene in the market place. Buchanan-Smith also said there may be a demand-supply gap in the 1990s for natural gas in Britain, but added that it would probably be less than had been previously estimated. Norway is a major producer of natural gas and this morning Norway's Energy Minister Arne Oien said he was hoping Britain will take more Norwegian gas in the 1990s. Buchanan-Smith also said he expects to announce the results of the 10th licensing round of North Sea tracts next month. He said there had been 75 applications for 127 tracts by 84 companies, and added that he expects about 50 blocks will be licensed. He said the results would be in line with rounds prior to but not equal to the ninth two years ago, which was one of the most successful ever."

shultz says u.s. wheat bonus offer up to usda,grain wheat,"U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said it was up to the Agriculture Department to decide whether to offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union. Shultz told the Newspaper Farm Editors of America that a wheat bonus offer to the Soviet Union ""is something that I basically leave to the Agriculture Department to figure out."" Last year, Shultz spoke out against President Reagan's decision to offer subsidized U.S. wheat to the Soviet Union -- an offer Moscow spurned. ""I've always been a little put off by the idea that we would arrange our food supplies so as to price them in such a way that the Soviet housewife could buy American-produced food for less than the American housewife could buy it,"" Shultz said. ""It also seems to me that if we are going to sell in world markets, we have to meet the price,"" he added. Shultz called proposals to broaden the eligibility criteria of USDA's export enhancement program (EEP) to include all U.S. customers ""questionable."" An across-the-board EEP would mark a ""considerable change"" in the current program, which Shultz said is designed ""to say to other countries that subsidize, particularly the European Common Market, that we're not going to give up our markets to those subsidized sales and we'll have a little kit bag that will meet that competition and hold our markets for our farmers."" ""If you just go across-the-board and subsidize everything, that's a different order of program and seems to me quite questionable,"" he said."
"u.s. beef, citrus talks with japan seen tough",carcass livestock orange,"The Reagan administration is expected to face tough resistance from Japan and from some entrenched U.S. interests, if it hopes to succeed in forcing Japan to end beef and citrus import controls by April, 1988, U.S. and Japanese officials said. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter took a hardline stance on beef and citrus in talks here last week, insisting that the quotas be abandoned by April, 1988. But that stance will be difficult to maintain because Japan will resist the pressure fiercely and because some U.S. suppliers of those commodities have an interest in maintaining the quotas, U.S. and Japanese officials told Reuters. Twice in the past, the United States has negotiated with Japan on beef and citrus import quotas -- during the Tokyo round of multilateral trade negotiations in 1978, and in bilateral talks in 1984. Each time the U.S. demanded an end to the quotas at the outset but ultimately accepted substantial increases instead. The current agreement calls for an increase in high quality beef imports to 58,400 tonnes in fiscal 1987, oranges to 126,000 tonnes and orange juice to 8,500 tonnes. Lyng has said repeatedly that this time the United States will not settle for simple increases in the quotas. Japan has been given plenty of time to reform its agricultural support system and the quotas must be scrapped, Lyng said. Japanese officials want to begin informal talks on beef and citrus in August or September in Hawaii, sources said. If the U.S. intends to press its tough stance, and Japan, as expected rejects the demands, the issue may then be put to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for settlement, which would mean prolonging the friction beyond the April, 1988 deadline set by the U.S., officials said. In interviews here, Japanese officials insist that on beef they will not liberalize imports, regardless of the U.S. pressure, because the Japanese beef industry is not competitive and would be damaged by freer trade. Most Japanese beef production still tends to be on small farms which Japanese officials said must be protected from cheap imports by use of the quota system. Furthermore, while the U.S. National Cattlemen's Association is strongly supporting the tough administration position, some U.S. meat exporters and packers are ambivalent. This is because to some U.S. exporters and packers beef exports to Japan under the quota system are a steady, reliable business managed by a quasi-government Japan Livestock Industry Promotion Corporation. Under quotas the U.S. share of Japan's beef market has expanded at the expense of Australia. In the absence of quotas, some U.S. suppliers are concerned the U.S. share might decline and exporting to Japan would become a riskier business, meat industry sources said. Major U.S meat industry leaders will meet in Washington next week, including cattlemen, processors and exporters, in an effort to reach an industry-wide consensus toward Japan. The citrus industry also appears split on the quota issue. California's Sunkist, the largest U.S. supplier of oranges to Japan, has expressed reservations about eliminating quotas. A representative of Sunkist said the cooperative is concerned that in the absence of quotas, lower quality oranges from Israel and South Africa might be competitive in Japan. Ironically, some Japanese officials hinted that fresh oranges may be a product on which imports could be freed with a minimum of impact on Japanese mandarin orange production. This is because U.S. oranges do not directly compete with smaller Japanese mandarins, officials said. But Japan wants to maintain quotas on orange juice because it fears imported juice tastes better and would displace Japanese mandarin orange juice, they said. One scenario mentioned by both U.S. and Japanese officials is that Tokyo may try to blunt the tough administration stance by offering to scrap the quota on fresh oranges in return for U.S. acceptance of increases in beef and juice quotas. Lyng has acknowledged that liberalization of beef and citrus imports is a difficult objective, but he insisted during the week-long tour here that it is a high priority on the U.S./Japan agriculture agenda-- more important than the rice issue which received most of the attention. Asked about the ambivalence of some in U.S. agribusiness, Lyng noted some interests on both the U.S. and Japanese side have benefited from quotas but this will not stop the administration from pressing for liberalization. And Lyng said the administration believes it can marshall more support for eliminating the quotas now than ever before, because of concern about Japan's rising trade surplus. ""We're coming at this one (beef and citrus negotiation) with a much stronger view coming out of Washington. The times have changed. The trade balance is much worse,"" Lyng said."
u.s. may have to act to support dollar,dlr money-fx,"The prospect of renewed assaults on the dollar might force the United States eventually to unveil distasteful measures to bolster support for its currency, monetary analysts and economists said. Treasury Secretary James Baker has acknowledged that the Reagan administration discussed the possibility of issuing yen-denominated U.S. government bonds to support the dollar. But he has also dismissed speculation that he was ready to take such an unusual step. Nonetheless, monetary sources say the issue has been seriously discussed by the administration. ""It is unlikely that we would undertake to do that now,"" Baker said last week. ""In our view there might well be some who would view (issuing U.S. yen bonds) as, in fact, a lack of confidence by the U.S. in its own currency. And therefore we don't think it's an appropriate thing to do."" But if the Reagan administration did announce measures, they could be a part of an internationally-coordinated effort to end the instability in financial markets with genuine action to reduce massive economic imbalances, monetary analysts believe. And, like a currency defense package unveiled by the Carter administration, issuing yen bonds could be accompanied by a rise in the discount rate, now 5.5 pct. The Federal Reserve has resisted pressure to raise this key rate so far, chiefly, some Fed officials say, because it could hurt economic growth. Another concern is the fragile international debt situation. Analysts who expect a currency support package are divided over its possible timing. Some even believe an announcement could come this week during a visit to Washington by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone. ""It would give some real focus to the visit, and it might steady the dollar and prevent it from going down,"" said Charles Taylor, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities. But monetary sources said they thought it unlikely that the Reagan administration would resort to measures which would bring to mind the troubles of President Carter. Until very recently, the current administration has urged a lower dollar to help redress its huge trade deficit while Carter faced a weak dollar as confidence in his economic policies collapsed. But today, Washington's policies are increasingly in question. The Carter plan was unleashed on Nov. 1, 1978. And it was a resounding success. ""This package really gave credibility to the administration to get the dollar up,"" said Robert Hormats, vice-president of Goldman Sachs Inc and a former senior U.S. economic in the Carter and Reagan Administrations. The dollar then stood at just under 1.87 marks and around 188 yen. Today it stands around 1.79 marks and 139 yen. ""The problem is now that the administration in rhetoric is evidencing concern about the dollar but in practice is really doing very little,"" Hormats said of statements to support the dollar by U.S. officials. Several currency traders and foreign central bank officials think these statements still fall short of unequivocally saying the dollar has declined far enough. Carter issued 6.4 billion dlrs of mark and swiss franc bonds aimed essentially at buttressing pyschological support for the dollar but also at attracting foreign investors, who had lost confidence in the dollar, to U.S. government notes. The package was supported by a one pct rise in the discount rate, to 9.5 pct, drawings on U.S. monetary reserves at the International Monetary Fund and sales of U.S.-held SDRS to other IMF members. It was also supported by increased Fed currency swap lines with other central banks and stepped up official U.S. gold sales. Stephen Axilrod, a former Fed official who is now vice-chairman of Nikko Securities, said, ""I think it's very unlikely they would do that now."" He argued that it was politically difficult to take action to support the dollar while Japan and West Germany have still to fulfill pledges to stimulate their economies. But most analysts believe a currency support package would only work if genuine economic measures to redress world trade imbalances are undertaken by the leading industrial powers. It could coincide with the June Venice summit of leaders of the seven major industrial democracies -- the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada. Hormats said he believed the currency has to decline slightly further for a package to have impact. He said the seven nations' Paris Accord to stabilize currencies was forged too soon to fundamentally change market sentiment. ""I think we're nearing a point when they would feel (politically) comfortable doing this,"" Hormats said. Many analysts think the administration's reluctance to act firmly on the dollar has been due to its desire to keep up the pressure on its allies to bolster their economies and for fear of fanning protectionist sentiment in Congress. But Hormats said ""there will be a point at which the government of the United States shows it does give a damn for the dollar."""
ec officials plan new effort on farm price talks,grain oilseed,"European Community (EC) leaders hope to make a new attempt to inject fresh urgency into talks on reforming the bloc's controversial farm policy when EC agriculture ministers meet for a third day of discussions here this morning. Community officials said farm commissioner Frans Andriessen met Belgian minister Paul de Keersmaeker late last night to plan a new initiative. Both Andriessen and de Keersmaeker, who currently chairs EC farm ministers' meetings, were said to be disappointed by the lack of progress in the talks so far this week. The bloc's executive Commission has proposed a tough package involving effective cuts of upwards of 10 pct in farmers' returns for many crops this year. Ministers were due to have adopted a package by April 1 but are only this week getting down to serious negotiations. Yesterday, they discussed plans to cut cereals prices by 2.5 pct, and reduce farmers' rights to sell surpluses to EC stores, to cut prices for fruit and vegetables by larger margins, and to impose a tax on EC-produced and imported oilseeds, a proposal which would be likely to sour EC trade relations with the United States. Diplomatic sources said ministers, all of whom are opposed to at least one of these propositions, maintained entrenched positions yesterday, making the task of de Keersmaeker in steering his colleagues towards a compromise a daunting one. They said he could also be treading a minefield if he sought to breach the divide between his fellow ministers over plans to change the system by which EC farm prices, expressed in a notional common currency, are translated into the currencies of member states. West German minister Ignaz Kiechle indicated yesterday he would veto the adoption of Commission proposals in this area, saying they would unfairly affect farmers in strong currency nations. The Belgian sources said de Keersmaeker may today present a paper to his colleagues which, while not having the status of a compromise proposal, would attempt to narrow their options. But diplomats said the philosophical gap between ministers like Kiechle, with his commitment to maintaining traditional rural patterns, and others who see runaway farm spending as unacceptable economically, is likely to prove extremely difficult to bridge. They agreed with EC farmers' union association president Hans Kjeldsen who said yesterday that an agreement in June appeared to be the best that could be hoped for."
nervous consolidation seen in currency futures,money-fx dlr stg,"Currency futures at the International Monetary Market (IMM) are likely to consolidate near current levels in nervous trading conditions over the next few days, although underlying sentiment remains positive, currency analysts said. ""Currencies are likely to muddle around these levels,"" said Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst Anne Parker Mills. Traders are unwilling to establish either long or short positions in futures because of uncertainty over upcoming trade talks and U.S. trade legislation, they said. Japanese prime minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and President Reagan will meet Thursday and Friday to discuss trade tensions between their two countries, while at the same time the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives will be voting on a controversial trade bill. ""Unless something really surprising comes out of the Nakasone/Reagan talks, I don't see the dollar getting above 142 (yen) and 1.83 (marks),"" Mills said. The equivalent in futures of those interbank levels are about 0.007050 to 0.007025 in the June yen contract and about 0.5500 in June marks, she said. June yen closed at 0.007191 on Tuesday while June marks finished the day at 0.5602. Mills said, however, that ""the chances of them (Reagan and Nakasone) coming up with something new are limited."" One possibility might be a Japanese discount rate cut, but ""they probably won't do that unless we raise our discount rate."" Recent firmness in the federal funds rate and the Federal Reserve's slowness in adding reserves to the banking system has heightened sentiment that the money-policy making body has already tightened credit and a discount rate hike is possible, analysts said. Recent weakness in currencies and strength in the dollar has been more the result of nervous shortcovering ahead of the meeting rather than reaction to the White House statement Monday supporting a stable dollar, said Harris bank currency analyst Earl Johnson. Traders ""are worried about the outcome of the talks between Reagan and Nakasone,"" and as the talks are late in the week, the market may not get a chance to react to any developments until Monday, Johnson said. Until then, Johnson expects the dollar to remain in a broad range between 1.77 and 1.85 marks and 137 to 140.50 yen. Chicago Corp analyst John Bilson, however, expects a rally in the European currencies over the near-term, while the yen, at this point is overbought. ""The Japanese are moving away from the U.S. market,"" and investment funds formerly directed to the U.S. are likely to flow into Europe, Bilson said. The chief beneficiary of such a flow of funds will be sterling, Bilson said. ""Sterling rates are about four pct above Japanese rates, despite the half point rate cut,"" Bilson said. Major U.K. banks lowered their base lending rates today to 9.5 pct. In addition to a favorable interest rate spread which should attract funds, Bilson said the firm oil market and the strong political situation of Prime Minister Thatcher also make British investments attractive. Passage of the trade bill, which includes an amendment by Missouri Democrat Richard Gephardt that would force a 10 pct annual cut in imports from countries with an excessive trade surplus with the U.S. if they fail to remove unfair trade barriers to the U.S. after six months of negatiations, would likely pressure the yen, Bilson said. Bilson, however, said the legislation is unlikely to pass, but that Nakasone is likely to bring a promise to open Japanese markets to U.S. goods and back it up with government contracts with U.S. manufacturers."
soviet says data sharing will help find oil,crude nat-gas,"A Soviet geologist said scientists need to coordinate data about onshore and offshore oil deposits to help identify global formations that would indicate other potential discoveries of oil and gas reserves. Vladmir Vladiminovich Semenovich, the head of petroleum geology at Moscow State University, told delegates at the World Petroleum Congress that exploration efficiency could also be improved through new and more sophisticated technology. ""We should emphasize that when having the data about petroleum distribution onshore and offshore, it is possible to clarify the idea of global regularities in oil and gas prospects,"" Semenovich said. ""However, much work should be done to coordinate data concerning the structure and oil and gas prospects in adjoining onshore and offshore basins."" Sharing the information could help geologists better predict regional trends and underground formations that indicate the presence of oil or gas, he said. Semenovich also said that existing estimates of the potential oil and natural gas resources of the world may need to be revised upward as oil companies continue to examine unexplored regions. The world, which has already produced 476 billion barrels of oil and gas, has a current total of about 733 billion barrels in proved reserves. Undiscovered resources are estimated at about 1.4 trillion barrels, or about half of the total ultimate reserves, Semenovich said. ""There are a lot of unstudied regions all over the world and, as far as the already known basins, one continues to find additional reserves,"" he said, noting that Antarctica has been virtually ignored. ""The existing estimate of potential resources of the world may need to be enlarged."" To find deeper and more expensive reserves, scientists will need to use 3-D mapping of underground formations and laser spectrometry to measure bitumen in soils and plants among other techniques, he said. He estimated that continental slopes contain about 10 to 13 pct of all offshore reserves. Semenovich also said that virtually all of the total oil and gas resources now estimated to exist in the world would be discovered and placed in production during the next 50 years. After his speech, Semenovich told Reuters that Soviet oil production was increasing. ""The difficulties of 1985 have been overcome and we're now back to normal production,"" he said. The Soviet Union, the world's largest producer of oil, had experienced drilling and technical problems that cut total liquids production from 12.45 mln barrels a day in 1984 to 12.1 mln barrels a day in 1985. Last year, the Soviets produced an estimated 12.3 mln barrels. When asked about the recent reopening and testing of a coal gasification project in Soviet Central Asia, Semenovich said the project was important because of the lack of oil reserves in the region. Semenovich declined to identify at what level of world oil prices the coal gasification process would become economic again. ""It's too expensive for the time being,"" Semenovich said. ""Theoretical development is underway and tests are being run. For the moment, coal gasification is a very small part of the energy industry,"" he said."
hong kong defends currency link with u.s. dollar,hk dlr money-fx,"Hong Kong has not taken unfair advantage of its currency's link with the U.S. Dollar, Hong Kong monetary affairs secretary David Nendick told the annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank here. He said: ""We have taken the rough with the smooth, having to accept a downward adjustment of our economy in 1985 following a period when the U.S. Dollar was clearly overvalued in world terms, but benefiting as that currency subsequently declined."" He said that since the establishment of the link in 1983, Hong Kong's trade had been broadly in balance. This year a modest deficit was expected. ""Under the link, Hong Kong's entirely free and open economy continues to adjust quickly to any external imbalances, but the burden of adjustment now falls almost entirely on our domestic interest rates, money supply and price levels,"" Nendick said. ""The relative volatility in these domestic variables is the price we pay for the stability of our currency against the U.S. Dollar,"" he said."
"taiwan reserves rise on trade surplus, speculation",reserves trade,"Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves have risen to a new high of 56 billion U.S. Dlrs, and officials attribute the increase to a surging trade surplus and the influx of speculative funds. The reserves, up from 54 billion dlrs on April 19, compare with 27.3 billion a year ago, the Central Bank said. Vice economic minister Wang Chien-shien told Reuters: ""The rising reserves will certainly intensify our trade friction with the U.S."" A central bank official, who declined to be named, said Taiwan's trade surplus is expected to exceed 5.5 billion U.S. Dlrs in the first four months of 1987, against 4.25 billion a year ago. The influx of speculative funds, mainly from Hong Kong, Japan and the U.S., Also played a major role behind the rise of the reserves, he said, but declined to give figures. Banking sources said almost 10 billion U.S. Dlrs had entered Taiwan since early 1986. About three billion of the funds were remitted through different channels, including the black market, since the start of this year, they said. Wang Chao-ming, vice chairman of the government's Council for Economic Planning and Development, said he expects the reserves to rise in the next few months because of the continuing high level of Taiwan's exports and the steady appreciation of the local dollar against the U.S. Currency. ""The latest government moves to open (the domestic) market, cut import tariffs and lift foreign exchange controls have achieved little success,"" he said. Vice economic minister Li Mo said tariffs were cut on some 1,700 products in January and a further 862 this month in a bid to encourage more imports, especially the U.S. More tariff cuts on about 300 imported products, including televisions, video tape recorders, cosmetics and refrigerators will be announced in a month or two, Li said. Li's colleague, Wang Chien-shien, said the government will send several trade missions to the U.S. This year to buy about one billion U.S. Dlrs of products, including machinery, power equipment, grains and precision tools. ""We earnestly hope to reduce our trade surplus with the U.S.,"" he said. Taiwan's trade surplus rose to a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985, and it widened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 against 2.78 billion a year ago, official statistics show. The surplus has increased U.S. Pressure on Taiwan for a faster appreciation of its currency, which has risen by about 18 pct since September 1985. It opened at 33.10 to the U.S. Dollar today."
german current account surplus widens in march,bop trade,"West Germany's current account surplus widened to a provisional 8.8 billion marks in March from a slightly downwards revised 6.5 billion in February, a spokesman for the Federal Statistics Office said. The trade surplus fell to a provisional 10.1 billion marks from 10.4 billion in February. The Statistics Office had earlier put the February current account surplus at a provisional 6.6 billion marks. The provisional February trade surplus was confirmed. The Office said the March trade surplus had also risen strongly from the year-ago month total of 8.5 billion marks, while the March current account surplus compared with only 4.3 billion marks a year earlier. The figures given by the office show nominal trade flows, but an office statement said that the current account surplus had also risen in real terms from February. However, it attributed this partly to the fact that payments to the European Community had been brought forward in February, with the result that transfers abroad in March were unusually low. The Statistics Office said March imports totalled 36.93 billion marks, a rise of 15 pct from February and of 4.7 pct compared with March 1986. March exports of 47.06 billion marks were 11 pct higher than in February and 7.6 pct higher than in March last year. Other data reported in the current account balance showed there was a 400 mln mark deficit in supplementary trade items, a 500 mln mark deficit in the services account and a 400 mln mark deficit in transfer payments. The Statistics Office said that in the first three months of this year the trade surplus had risen to 27.8 billion marks from 22.6 billion marks in the same period last year. The current account surplus had risen to 20.0 billion marks from 15.6 billion."

The new cd's, with maturities of six months, one and two years, bear interest of 4.03 to 5.12 pct. The issues are intended to help curb the growth of m-1b money supply resulting from large foreign exchange reserves which the bank said today had reached a record 56 billion U.S. Dlrs."

china's wage bill grew too fast in first quarter,income ipi,"China's total wage bill for state employees grew too fast in the first quarter, because of excessive bonuses, allowances and overtime pay, the official Economic Information newspaper said. It said the total wage bill in the period was 38.7 billion yuan, an increase of 16.7 pct over the first quarter of 1986, when the bill grew a year-on-year 16.3 pct. The increase accounted for 39.6 pct of planned wage rises in all of 1987. It said bonus payments rose a 42.6 pct, far in excess of growth in productivity. Industrial output grew a 14.1 pct in the period. The newspaper said state allowances rose in the period by 20 pct over the corresponding 1986 quarter, with some areas and work units increasing coal and electricity allowances on their own without proper authorisation. It said overtime pay rose a year-on-year 32 pct, with some enterprises ignoring official regulations in their payments."
west german tapioca use seen declining,meal-feed tapioca grain barley,"West German use of tapioca is likely to decline further despite favourable prices and import licences for only 420,000 tonnes have been registered since the start of the current agricultural year, compared with 640,000 tonnes during August/April the previous year, trade sources said. The 12 European Community (EC) countries have licensed a total of 4.22 mln tonnes, while at the same year-earlier period the EC contracted for 3.17 mln tonnes, they said. The Netherlands is registering an increase in licences to around 2.9 mln tonnes, up 400,000 tonnes from last year, they said. Total EC tapioca imports during the current agricultural year are expected to stagnate at last year's level of around 6.0 mln tonnes, the sources said. They reported a rise in consumption and in import licences for France, Spain and Belgium but said the West German compound feed industry was increasingly using grain in feed mixtures. Sellers quoted tapioca for nearby delivery at around 27 marks per 100 kilos against 37 marks in March and 34 marks in April last year. Feed barley was quoted at about 42 marks per 100 kilos, resulting in higher West German feed stuff prices, but demand was seen as slack. The sources said the West German feed industry was trying to help cut the grain surplus through increased use of grain in feed mixtures. Other EC member countries are likely to take advantage of the lower tapioca prices, they said."
taiwan central bank defends dollar reserves policy,reserves dlr money-fx,"Central Bank governor Chang Chi-cheng defended Taiwan's policy of holding a large amount of its foreign exchange reserves in U.S. Dollars, citing similar policies followed by countries such as West Germany and Japan. The reserves, now a record 56 billion U.S. Dlrs, are the world's largest after those of West Germany and Japan. About 90 pct is held in U.S. Dollars and the rest in yen and marks. Chang's remarks to parliament were in response to a call on Monday by about 20 members of the parliament who asked the government to diversify into other currencies, including yen, marks and Swiss francs because of exchange rate losses. The legislators said the bank lost about 3.8 billion U.S. Dlrs between September 1985 and September 1986 as the Taiwan dollar rose to 36.77 to the U.S. Dollar from 40.45. They said they expected the losses to continue because of the rising Taiwan dollar against the U.S. Currency. Chang said the central bank could not sell the U.S. Dollars like other private banks or enterprises because such trading would be speculative and risky. ""The U.S. Dollar is an international currency and is widely used among trading nations,"" he added. Chang said the Central Bank has further revised foreign exchange rules, which would relax most controls or even suspend them. The revised rules have been submitted to the cabinet for approval, he said. He declined to give details."

thai economy to achieve five pct growth this year,gnp trade cpi,"Thailand's gross domestic product will expand five pct this calendar year, up from 3.8 pct in 1986, despite a projected slight decline in agricultural output due to drought, the Bank of Thailand said. Central bank spokesman Siri Karncharoendi told reporters the Thai economy clearly recovered in the first quarter from the lingering effects of the 1984-85 recession. He said the industrial sector is expected to expand 5.5 pct this year, up from five pct in 1986. Agricultural output is projected to grow 2.8 pct after 1.5 pct contraction in 1986. He said January/March imports grew 19.2 pct to 70.7 billion baht, in response to an improving domestic market, compared with a nine pct decline to 59.3 billion a year ago. Non-oil imports grew 24.8 pct to 60.2 billion baht while oil imports declined 5.6 pct to 10.5 billion. First quarter exports increased 12.7 pct to 63.2 billion baht compared with 14.4 pct and 56.1 billion a year ago. Siri said he expects the trade deficit to widen to about 30 billion baht this year from 17.4 billion in 1986. The current account, which last year posted a surplus of 3.5 billion baht, is projected to return to a 7.4 billion deficit in 1987. He said overall January/March lending by the Thai banking system grew a strong nine pct to 577.9 billion baht, up from 4.7 pct growth in the previous quarter and 5.8 pct for the whole of 1986. He said the Thai consumer price index rose 1.8 pct in the first quarter, down from 2.3 pct a year ago, but added that with the economy picking up, inflation is expected to rise to 2.5 pct this year from 1.9 pct for the whole 1986."
ec farm ministers end prices meeting still divided,oilseed grain veg-oil,"European Community (EC) agriculture ministers ended a three-day meeting in Luxembourg still deeply divided over plans by the EC Commission to curb the cost of the EC's farm policy through sharp cuts in farm returns. Their chairman, Belgium's Paul de Keersmaeker, told a news conference after the meeting he would work on a paper setting out possible compromise solutions in the next two weeks, with the hope that the ministers can get down to detailed negotiations at a meeting in Brussels on May 18. But diplomats said the talks this week had served little more than to clarify member states' positions on the complex package of measures proposed by the commission. The executive body has proposed measures which would result in price cuts this year for many crops of upwards of 10 pct. Other controversial plans include a tax on EC-produced and imported oilseeds and fats to bring in two billion European currency units, to help the EC's cash crisis, and changes in the conversion of EC common farm prices into national currencies which would inflict extra burdens on West German and Dutch farmers. De Keersmaeker attempted yesterday to narrow differences between EC states on the oils tax proposal, the currency measures and the key question of cereals prices and associated measures. But he told journalists, ""We have used this meeting to reach the point at which real negotiations can start at the next meeting. Ideally they should have started now but our procedures took much longer than planned."" Ministers are in theory supposed to agree a price package by April 1 each year, although this target is seldom reached in practice. Diplomats said on all the points there were widely diverging views, with Britain and the Netherlands, the countries most supportive of commission proposals for cereals price cuts, strongly opposed to the oils tax. However, de Keersmaeker said West German objections to the monetary proposals could prove the most difficult issue to resolve. ""This is a very tough political nut, and because of the very nature of the problem there is no technical solution,"" he said. Commission sources said farm commissioner Frans Andriessen was prepared to alter some technical aspects of his proposals to make an agreement easier. However, because of the EC's budgetary crisis, he had little room for concessions to pleas for a cut in the impact of his proposals on farmers' incomes as several ministers, led by Germany's Ignaz Kiechle, are demanding. EC Commission president Jacques Delors has warned that the EC will have an accumulated budgetary deficit of over five billion Ecus by the end of this year, even if the commission farm price package is adopted in its entirety."

Kericho, which last year received 387 mm in April last year, has so far recorded only 176 mm and little rain is forecast throughout the country in the next two days.

Grains and pulses (except maize) were sown on 6.7 mln ha, compared with 13.1 mln at the same time last year, it added. Spring sowing is off to a slow start, with planting two to four weeks behind schedule in many areas of the Ukraine, Byelorussia and Russia, because the winter was unusually cold. Western agricultural experts believe the crop could still be good but heavy winterkill will make it difficult to reach the 1987 grain target of 232 mln tonnes. The 1986 crop was 210 mln."
swiss prepared to increase currency intervention,money-fx sfr money-supply,"The Swiss National Bank is prepared to increase its intervention on currency markets if the action can be properly coordinated with other central banks, Markus Lusser, a member of the Bank's three man directorate, said. He told a meeting of Swiss industrialists that intervention to support the dollar could not bring about lasting changes in exchange rates unless accompanied by fundamental changes in economic policy. However, intervention could send signals that would contribute to a short term smoothing of currency movements. The National Bank was prepared to intensify cooperation with other central banks, especially where convincing coordination and significant timing are guaranteed, Lusser said. He said currency developments could not simply be talked into existence but needed to be matched by actions in the field of economic policy. ""Put simply, that means that in order to stabilise the dollar in a lasting way, a reduction of the budget deficit and a slowdown in money supply growth in the United States are unavoidable,"" he said. The National Bank has intervened in dollar-yen repeatedly in the last few weeks and earlier this week it said it had intervened in dollar-Swiss franc for the first time since last October. Lusser said the key to increased exchange rate stability lay not in currency intervention by central banks but only in an improvement in international economic policy coordination. This meant that industrial countries must avoid abrupt switches in economic policy and give priority to price stability. Lusser said the National Bank continued to take the view that easing its strict monetary policies would be incompatible with its primary goal of combatting inflation. The bank target is for growth of two pct in central bank money supply in 1987. He noted that in 1978, when the Swiss franc rose sharply against all currencies, the bank was forced to abandon its money supply targets in favour of an exchange rate target, with the result that inflation surged. ""Current exchange rate developments have not, until today at any rate, made any such measures by the National Bank necessary,"" he said."
lower mark rate speculation not shared in germany,money-fx dmk interest,"Speculation abroad that the Bundesbank will steer money market rates lower, opening the for interest rate cuts around Europe, is not shared by many economists and money market dealers within Germany. Speculation has developed that the Bundesbank would engineer lower rates to take pressure off the dollar/mark. A strong rise in U.S. Market rates this month, prompting speculation the Fed would raise its 5-1/2 pct discount rate, has raised the question whether Germany and Japan would also broaden interest rate differentials to support the dollar. The U.S.-Japanese trade dispute is the key to the interest rate outlook, money market dealers in Paris said. Talks this week between Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and President Reagan, if successful, could take pressure off the dollar, dealers and economists said. Short term interest rates would be likely to ease if the trade dispute is solved and the dollar steadies, they said. But if no solution is found, the Paris dealers said, a renewed dollar fall would put strains on the mark/French franc rate and force the Bank of France to raise short-term rates. The three-month U.S. Treasury bill rate rose to six pct this week from 5.6 pct at the start of April, and the yield on the 30-year benchmark treasury bonds rose this week in Tokyo to a 14-month high of 8.86 pct from 7.66 pct in late March. The dollar stabilized today just below 1.80 marks and above 140 yen, underpinned by higher U.S. Rates and the Fed discount rate speculation. But most dealers expect it to weaken further, which would put pressure on the Bundesbank to ease interest rates. Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said yesterday the U.S. Had requested Japan to cut short-term interest rates. The Bank of Japan was making efforts to do this, he said, adding the U.S. Had not asked for a cut in Japan's 2.5 pct discount rate, a move which Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said was not under consideration. A call for a German move came yesterday from Dutch central bank president Wim Duisenberg, who said the Dutch central bank favoured a cut in West German interest rates and would follow suit if it happened. Citibank AG said in its April report that another expected phase of dollar weakness would prompt the Bundesbank to cut key money market rates in the next three to six months. The Bundesbank has set a fixed rate of 3.80 pct on repurchase pacts since February, with call money trading around 3.70 pct for much of April. Phillips and Drew senior European economist Richard Reid said the Bundesbank would allow interest rates to ease further, either with a lower fixed rate tender, or a tender by interest rate, allowing the market to set the rate. ""I'm fairly confident we'll see lower rates,"" he said. Reid said taking 30 basis points off the repurchase rate would have little impact on the German economy or fundamental exchange rates, but could change market currency perceptions. ""A cut in German rates wouldn't be bad for the dollar, but I think its effect would be limited in duration unless it was accompanied by other measures elsewhere,"" he said. Money market dealers here noted the speculation abroad that the Bundesbank would push down repurchase rates, but said the Bundesbank had little reason to cut rates further at the moment, despite the liquid market seen for most of this month. The dealers said the Bundesbank was likely to move to an interest rate tender for its repurchase pacts next month. That should not be seen as a sign of easing monetary policy however, they said. The Bundesbank would merely be experimenting with interest rate tenders, following the introduction of a new system to speed up the tender process at the start of April, they said. Reinhard Pohl, head of the monetary policy section at the DIW economic research institute in West Berlin, said the Bundesbank would probably not cut rates on repurchase pacts. ""I don't think that if they cut the repurchase rate a little it would stop a wave of (currency) speculation,"" he said. But a sharp and sudden deterioration in the dollar could force the Bundesbank to take some action, he said. Pohl said the Bundesbank was concerned that a cut in interest rates would accelerate excessive monetary growth. Some Bundesbank officials have argued recently that the monetary overshoot was due to strong currency inflows rather than credit growth, and therefore a more appropriate response to excessive money supply growth would be to cut rates, to make the mark and mark investments less attractive. Pohl said the Bundesbank was hoping that domestic investors would switch funds parked in liquid short-term accounts, which have swollen central bank money stock, into securities, which would take them out of the Bundesbank's key monetary measure. A cut in interest rates at this stage however would lead investors to assume that rates had bottomed out and the next move would be upwards. They would therefore hold off buying bonds, leaving central bank money stock swollen. There are so far no signs that German investors are switching funds into long term securities as the Bundesbank hopes they will, Berliner Handels- und Frankfurter Bank economist Hermann Remsperger said. But Phillips and Drew's Reid said prospects of lower rates and a strong currency would attract foreign investors into German bonds, which would in turn attract domestic investors. Werner Rein, chief economist at Union Bank of Switzerland in Zurich, said he thought it likely that interest rates would continue to drift lower in many European countries. ""The scope for lower rates is probably greatest in Britain but more limited in West Germany, where we could see some consolidation,"" he said. Switzerland could be forced to match any cut in German rates to prevent the franc rising further against the mark, he said. Currency dealers in London said another half-point cut in U.K. Bank base rates was likely in the next few weeks as the pound had shrugged off yesterday's cuts and was still rising."
swiss prepared to increase currency intervention,money-fx sfr money-supply,"The Swiss National Bank is prepared to increase its intervention on currency markets if the action can be properly coordinated with other central banks, Markus Lusser, a member of the Bank's three man directorate, said. He told a meeting of Swiss industrialists that intervention to support the dollar could not bring about lasting changes in exchange rates unless accompanied by fundamental changes in economic policy. However, intervention could send signals that would contribute to a short term smoothing of currency movements. The National Bank was prepared to intensify cooperation with other central banks, especially where convincing coordination and significant timing are guaranteed, Lusser said. He said currency developments could not simply be talked into existence but needed to be matched by actions in the field of economic policy. ""Put simply, that means that in order to stabilise the dollar in a lasting way, a reduction of the budget deficit and a slowdown in money supply growth in the United States are unavoidable,"" he said. The National Bank has intervened in dollar-yen repeatedly in the last few weeks and earlier this week it said it had intervened in dollar-Swiss franc for the first time since last October. Lusser said the key to increased exchange rate stability lay not in currency intervention by central banks but only in an improvement in international economic policy coordination. This meant that industrial countries must avoid abrupt switches in economic policy and give priority to price stability. Lusser said the National Bank continued to take the view that easing its strict monetary policies would be incompatible with its primary goal of combatting inflation. The bank target is for growth of two pct in central bank money supply in 1987. He noted that in 1978, when the Swiss franc rose sharply against all currencies, the bank was forced to abandon its money supply targets in favour of an exchange rate target, with the result that inflation surged. ""Current exchange rate developments have not, until today at any rate, made any such measures by the National Bank necessary,"" he said."
ccc acepts bonus bid on wheat to zaire - usda,grain wheat,"The Commodity Credit Crporation has accepted a bid for an export bonus to cover the sale of 8,000 tonnes of hard red winter wheat to Zaire, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. The wheat is scheduled for shipment May 11-June 11, 1987, the department said. The bonus, to Continental Grain Co, was 32.55 dlrs per tonne and will be paid in the form of commodities from CCC stocks. An additional 7,000 tonnes of wheat are still available to Zaire under the Export Enhancement program initiative announced on October 17, 1986, it said."
u.s. march leading index signals modest growth,lei gnp,"A 0.4 pct rise in the March U.S. index of leading indicators points to continued moderate U.S. real economic growth, economists said. ""The report is consistent with a modestly growing economy,"" said Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities Inc. ""The economy is not robust, but we're not heading into a recession either."" ""The report suggests more of the same: continued moderate growth,"" said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Government and Co Inc. ""The gain was mostly in stock prices. There was no change in the fundamental movement of the economy."" The Commerce Department said that higher stock prices led the March gain. Unemployment claims, vendor performance, contracts and orders for plant and equipment, manufacturers' orders, and building permits also were positive. The average workweek, raw materials prices, and money supply detracted from the index. Economists noted that the index signals the direction but not the magnitude of changes in gross national product. ""You can't derive profound conclusions on the economy from the report,"" McCarthy said. ""The link between leading indicators and the economy is not strong."""
"u.k. economy stronger than at budget, lawson says",gnp cpi bop,"The U.K. Economy looks stronger than it did only last month, when the government unveiled its budget for fiscal 1987/88, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said. He told Parliament that ""all the indicators that have been published since the budget confirm that, if anything, we are doing even better than I suggested then."" The budget was unveiled on March 17. ""The PSBR (Public Sector Borrowing Requirement) has come out lower than I forecast in the Budget. Inflation, too, is lower than I suggested ... (and) the current account of the balance of payments is also performing better, so far, than I predicted."" The budget foresaw inflation easing to 4.0 pct at the end of this year after peaking at around 4.5 pct. Lawson said at the time that the overall 1986/87 PSBR would be around 4.0 billion stg. It was in fact lower, at 3.3 billion stg. He had also projected average GDP growth in calendar 1987 of 3.0 pct after 2.5 pct in 1986. Lawson today said ""output appears to be rising, if anything, rather faster."" Speaking during a House of Commons debate, he said, ""by the end of this year we will have registered the longest period of steady growth, at close to 3.0 pct a year, that the British economy has known since the (Second World) War."" The 1987/88 budget contained a proposal to cut the basic rate of taxation by two pence, to 27 pence in the pound. Lawson today reaffirmed that the government aimed to further cut the standard rate to ""no more than 25p."" He said that that objective ""should not take too long to achieve."" Turning to policies proposed by political opposition parties, Lawson said those advocated by the Labour Party would entail extra public expenditure of some 34 billion stg. That, he said, ""would require either a doubling of the basic rates of income tax or more than trebling the standard rate of (valued added tax) VAT,"" which is currently 15 pct. On value added tax, Lawson noted that the Conservative government promised back in 1984 not to extend VAT to food. ""Beyond that, the incidence of taxation has to be determined in the light of the budgetary needs at the time, and no responsible government could conceivably take any other position,"" he said. Labour MPs have accused the Conservatives of planning VAT increases for some essential consumer goods. Lawson reiterated his belief that reductions in taxation can often produce higher, not lower, revenues ""thus leading to the scope for still further reductions in taxation."" Lawson said ""inheritance tax is expected this year to yield almost 50 pct more in real terms than Capital Transfer Tax did in 1978-79. The yield of Capital Gains Tax is forecast to be 80 pct higher in real terms, and Stamp Duty up by 140 pct."" He said that ""the greatly increased yield of Corporation Tax, reflecting greatly increased company profitability, is clearly connected with the reform of Corporation Taxation I introduced in 1984, which brought the rate of tax on company profits in this country to the lowest in the industrialised world."""
egypt fuel price increases part of reform package,fuel heat jet gas money-fx,"Egypt has embarked on reforms sought by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank by raising the price of diesel oil and other types of transport fuels. The energy price increases were the first visible measures taken in return for IMF standby credits and World Bank loans. Effective today, fuel oil prices were trebled and prices of gas oil, diesel and kerosene went up by over 50 pct, an Egyptian General Petroleum Corp (EGPC) official said. He said fuel oil will sell for 28 Egyptian pounds a ton, instead of 7.5 pounds. Kerosene and gas oil were raised by 66 pct to sell for five piasters a litre, while diesel rose 50 pct to 4.5 piasters. The government is expected also to act soon, possibly as early as next weekend, to simplify the country's complex exchange rate system, bankers said. Moving towards a more realistic exchange rate for the pound was part of a package of reforms sought by the IMF and creditor governments. In return, Egypt stands to receive up to one billion dlrs in IMF standby credits phased over three years to help it repay its 38.6 billion dlr foreign debt and guarantee rescheduling by western governments, the main creditors. Energy price increases were also a condition of progress on World Bank project loans of up to 800 mln dlrs in energy, communications and other sectors which have been under negotiation for several months, western diplomats said. The U.S. And Western Europe have pledged political backing for President Hosni Mubarak's government, committed to a multi-party political system and peace with Israel and strategically poised in control of the Suez Canal. Fuel price rises, postponed at least once and likely to lead to higher retail prices of basic goods, were a test of the government's resolve to pursue economic reform, diplomats said. But the new prices are still below world market levels. There was no announcement of increases in more politically sensitive products such as gasoline or natural gas, used for cooking, and the mass-circulation Al-Akhbar newspaper said they would stay the same. Official comment was not available on speculation among bankers and diplomats that the Central Bank would soon tinker with the pound's exchange rates to try to channel more dollars into the banking system away from the illegal but tolerated free market. The Central Bank was expected to set up a committee in which 10 commercial banks, including the four state-owned banks, would decide the pound's value every day. The official ""incentive rate,"" currently set by the Central Bank daily, is around 1.36 pounds to the dollar, against 2.15 on the free market. Bankers predicted that the banks' committee might set rates around 1.80 or 1.90. But some doubted this would serve the aim of curbing the free market."
offshore oil drilling moving into deeper waters,crude nat-gas,"Offshore drilling for oil and gas will be moving into deeper and deeper waters, according to Ronald L. Geer, a consultant with Shell Oil Co. and president of the Marine Technology Society. Geer told a press conference at the Offshore Technology Conference that the technology existed to drill exploratory wells in up to 10,000 feet of water. But he added that as the industry moves more and more to floating systems as opposed to fixed bottom supported structures, the financial risks involved were greater. He said such projects involved six to nine year time frames, and there was a ""reluctance for people to stick their necks too far out."" Shell holds the world record for the deepest exploratory well, at 6,900 feet, in the Wilmington Canyon in the Atlantic offshore New Jersey in 1984. The company is currently drilling a 6,700 foot well in the Atwater Valley in the Gulf of Mexico offshore Louisiana. Meanwhile, Brazil's Petrobras set a world record for underwater production when they brought a well in 1,350 feet of water offshore Rio de Janeiro state into production in January. Geer said the industry was particularly interested in the Green Canyon field offshore Louisiana where a number of companies, including Shell, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell <RD>, Dupont Co's <DD> Conoco Inc, USX Corp's <X> Marathon Oil Co, Standard Oil Co <SRD> and <Placid Oil Co>, are working, many of them testing new deep-water technologies. Of particular interest is the controversial Penrod-72 system being operated by the Dallas-based Hunt brothers who last year placed Placid Oil under bankruptcy court protection in order to avoid foreclosures on its valuable oil properties. They have been seeking the right to use assets to drill oil wells in the Green Canyon through Penrod, arguing that continued development of the project is essential to their ability to get out of their financial crisis. Earlier this month, the Hunts were granted permission by a bankruptcy court to pursue the Green Canyon project. The Penrod system involves a controversial floating production platform with well heads sitting 1,350 feet down on the ocean floor. Some 24 wells will be attached to the wellhead, with one satellite well sitting in a record 1,700 feet of water. Geer said he could not comment on the Penrod project, other than to note that it involves so many new technologies, it might have a problem fitting all the pieces together within a specific time frame. He also said he believed the potential production from the project could be in line with what the Hunt Brothers have projected . The Hunts' creditor banks have contended the Hunts have exaggerated the potential of the project. ""They're in the ballpark,"" he said, of the numbers, adding that he did not have enough information to comment further."
reagan warns on further dollar fall,dlr money-fx,"President Reagan said a further decline in the value of the dollar could be counterproductive. In written answers to questions put by Japan's Asahi Shimbun newspaper, he noted Treasury Secretary James Baker had said all seven major industrial nations were committed to cooperating in fostering stability of exchange rates. ""We all believe a further decline of the dollar could be counterproductive,"" Reagan said. Reagan said the best way for the United States to reduce its trade deficit was to export more. He said Japan could make a major contribution to reducing external imbalances and sustaining world economic growth by adopting policies to promote stronger domestic demand in the short-run and, in the long-run, implementing structural reforms to ease Japanese dependence on exports as a source of growth."

""Members rejected the latest offer by a 2 to 1 margin,"" Bob Wilson, executive officer of local 174 said. But workers have been asked to remain on the job while negotiations continue. The union has been in negotiations with the Greater New York Association of Meat and Poultry Dealers, a group of meat wholesalers and distributors. The contract expired April 26 and the latest management offer sought ""give backs"" in holiday and sick leave which the membership rejected, Wilson said."
bangladesh keeps options open on grain penalty,grain wheat,"Bangladesh is keeping its options open on whether to seek a penalty from Continental Grain Co of the United States for alleged breach of a wheat shipment contract, but is also asking the company to expedite shipment of the cargo, a senior Food Ministry official said. The official, who declined to be named, said the company under a deal agreed to ship 100,000 tonnes of wheat by April 7 and another 100,000 tonnes by April 16. But it shipped only 126,000 tonnes altogether. The supplier will have to pay penalty at a rate of two dlrs per tonne for every delayed day according to a document signed by both the Food Ministry and the suppliers' agent in Dhaka, he told Reuters. ""If they arrange quick shipment, we may take a lenient view,"" the official said. The issue is expected to be decided at a cabinet meeting scheduled for next Sunday, he added. A pro-government Bengali daily ""Dainik Janata"" reported today that Continental Grain could face a penalty of 200 mln taka (6.49 mln dlrs) for alleged failure to maintain shipment schedule. The local agent of Continental Grain, Shafi Ahmed Choudhury, told Reuters he applied to the Bangladesh government for an extension of the shipment period because loading of wheat at London was being delayed due to bad weather and a faulty elevator at a grain silo. But the government has not yet granted the extension, he said. Choudhury said the freight rate and price of wheat had gone up after the deal was signed, which resulted in a financial loss to the company. He said he was not ""officially informed"" of the move to impose a penalty, although he was ""not totally unaware of it."" Continental Grain officials in New York declined to comment."
recent u.s. oil demand up 0.6 pct from year ago,crude gas fuel,"U.S. oil demand as measured by products supplied rose 0.6 pct in the four weeks ended April 17 to 15.91 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 15.82 mln in the same period a year ago, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said. In its weekly petroleum status report, the Energy Department agency said distillate demand was off 10.2 pct in the period to 2.67 mln bpd from 2.98 mln a year earlier. Gasoline demand averaged 6.94 mln bpd, off 1.8 pct from 7.06 mln last year, while residual fuel demand was 1.17 mln bpd, off 12.9 pct from 1.34 mln, the EIA said. Domestic crude oil production was estimated at 8.36 mln bpd, down 5.9 pct from 8.88 mln a year ago, and gross daily crude imports (excluding those for the SPR) averaged 3.70 mln bpd, up 5.2 pct from 3.52 mln, the EIA said. Refinery crude runs in the four weeks were 12.58 mln bpd, up 2.0 pct from 12.33 mln a year earlier, it said. In the first 113 days of the year, refinery runs were up 2.3 pct to an average 12.36 mln bpd from 12.09 mln in the year-ago period, the EIA said. Year-to-date demand for all petroleum products averaged 16.26 mln bpd, up 1.6 pct from 15.99 mln in 1986, it said. So far this year, distillate demand fell 3.1 pct to 3.11 mln bpd from 3.21 mln in 1986, gasoline demand was 6.71 mln bpd, off 0.3 pct from 6.73 mln, and residual fuel demand fell 6.2 pct to 1.32 mln bpd from 1.40 mln, the EIA said. Year-to-date domestic crude output was estimated at 8.38 mln bpd, off 7.4 pct from 9.05 mln a year ago, while gross crude imports averaged 3.86 mln bpd, up 21.1 pct from 3.19 mln, it said."
senior economist predicts 30 pct fall in dollar,dlr money-fx,"a senior economist predicted the u.s. dollar would decline another 30 pct by year-end, but said he foresees no significant change in u.s. interest rates. ""the market recognizes another 30 pct dollar depreciation is necessary,"" said rudiger dornbush of the massachusetts institute of technology. he said the only thing preventing the dollar from dropping far below current levels was intervention by central banks in definace of market forces. he said artifical support of the dollar had put the world's financial markets in an ""excessively volatile"" position, however, and predicted that within about four months ""it is going to be very difficult to keep the dollar in place."" the forecasts, dornbush added, are for ""a steady deterioration from now on."" dornbush, a university of chicago-educated economist, works with the national bureau of economic research as well as mit. he spoke here at the invitation of panama's national banking association, sponsor of a three-day international banking convention that got under way yesterday. dornbush discarded fears of soaring u.s. interest rates because of the declining dollar. ""the u.s. cannot raise interest rates. if it raises interest rates all the debts will bounce in the foreign sector ... and all over latin america,"" he said."
u.s. interior secretary opposes oil import fee,crude nat-gas,"U.S. Interior Secretary Donald Hodel said he does not support an oil import fee as a means to stimulate domestic oil and gas production. ""I am an advocate for incentives for exploration,"" Hodel said, but added, ""I do not favor an oil import fee."" ""It would inject the federal government so deeply back in to the process, we would never get the government out again, and I think that would be in the long term disinterest of the nation,"" Hodel said in an address to a group of local business executives. Earlier today, Congressmen from oil producing states introduced a bill that would impose a fee on oil imports. Hodel said he supports drilling incentives, such as repeal of the Windfall Profits Tax and Fuel Use Act and deregulation of natural gas. The secretary also said oil and gas exploration offshore California and in the Artic National Wildlife Refuge is necessary to prevent the U.S. from becoming too dependent on foreign supplies of oil for its energy needs. Failure to approve such exploration, Hodel said, would lead to greater U.S. dependence on foreign sources of oil. ""In the next two to five years, no matter what we do today, we are very likely to find the U.S becoming 50 pct or more dependent on imports for its oil requirements,"" Hodel said. If OPEC were to raise oil prices sharply, Congress would likely act to have the federal government fix gasoline prices and allocate supplies, Hodel said. ""If they allocate supplies you and I, in the same two-to-five year time frame, could well find ourselves sitting back in gas lines,"" Hodel said. Exploration for oil and gas in offshore areas and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge would not jeopardize environmentally sensitive areas, Hodel said. ""We are convinced we can meet and resolve every environmental concern that is raised,"" Hodel said."

The ministry previously revised pump prices and announced the changes for the oil companies. Lead content of petrol is further cut to 0.15 gm/litre from 0.4 gm from today. Pump prices of the lower lead petrol grades are expected to be announced soon by the oil companies which have said wholesale prices are between 1.3 cents/litre to 3.2 cents higher than previous grades."
china province becomes grain importer,grain orange sugar,"The south China province of Guangdong is importing millions of tonnes of grain a year from overseas and other parts of China because farmers have switched from grain to more profitable crops, the Peking Review magazine said. The official magazine said the province's grain area fell to 4.33 mln hectares in 1985 from 5.7 mln in 1978 out of a total farmland area of 7.4 mln hectares. Farmers have switched to cash crops such as sugarcane, bananas, oranges, papaya and freshwater fish-farming, in part to supply major consumer markets in Hong Kong and Macao, the magazine said. It gave no 1986 area figures. The magazine said China aims to keep 80 pct of national farmland under grain, 10 pct under cash crops and 10 pct under other crops, although the ratio will vary from place to place. It said primitive cultivation methods, labour-intensity and low productivity make grain the least profitable farm commodity. Farmers in one central region of China can from 0.1 hectare earn 2,250 yuan a year from vegetables, 375-450 yuan from cotton or 225 yuan from grain, it added. It said consumer prices for foodgrain can be adjusted only gradually as part of a reform of the entire pricing system."
philippine coconut chief to lobby against ec tax,veg-oil coconut copra-cake meal-feed palm-oil coconut-oil,"Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) chairman Jose Romero said he would visit Brussels later this month to lobby against a proposed 100 pct European Community (EC) levy on vegetable oil imports. ""I intend to visit Brussels and talk to whoever is putting up this devilish scheme to impoverish third world countries like the Philippines,"" Romero said in an interview. He said he did not know how much support the levy had within the EC but he said he believed those originally opposed to the tax were under pressure to change their position. Romero said a group of EC members led by West Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway were opposed to the tax. But there was a danger some of them would be persuaded to change sides, and if that happened opposition could crumble. Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warning that copra meal cake used in livestock feeds contained dangerous levels of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic chemical. He said the EC standard of 0.02 parts of aflatoxin per million parts of meal, which EC countries had been asked to apply by October 1988, was too rigid. He said Philippine copra cake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin. Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when it is not properly dried or ground. Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal in London that the Philippines was doing its best to meet EC standards. It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally, but this was likely to take several years of research. Copra meal exports were 817,641 tonnes or 35 pct of total coconut exports in 1986. The meal was worth 73.5 mln dlrs. Romero said he would also visit Oxford University's department of agricultural economics to discuss ways of avoiding the copra process altogether. ""There are ways of producing coconut products outside of copra,"" Romero said. ""We can process fresh coconut without drying the meat in the sun. Through the wet process we can process coconuts into other food or non-food products, or we can go to the chemical root."" He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries to become more protectionist and he expected export prices of coconut products to drop. ""In the long term we will be getting less and less for more and more production, and I'm not comfortable with that,"" he said. With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping up production of palm oil, a coconut oil substitute, palm oil output had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971, Romero said. ""To add to that the U.S. Soybean Association is spending billions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil by saying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart,"" he said. Romero said he expected coconut product export prices to stay up for the rest of the year. They would probably touch a high of 20 cents/pound from the current level of 18.59 cents, and a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 10.50 cents. Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-year coconut production cycle which showed production tended to fall after two successive years of good harvests. He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year, to add to the production fall, drought had affected output. ""Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought the prices will start declining again. The only sure way to keep prices stable is by processing, adding more value,"" he said. Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop by planting other cash crops between coconut trees, he said. ""A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on 10,000 square metres of land. That's a lot of space,"" Romero said. He said the government's proposed land reform program would exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because they had less than the proposed seven-hectares of land. ""If the idea of land reform is to increase income levels, production and employment then it won't happen,"" he said. PCA figures show about one-third of the country's population is dependent on the coconut industry. Coconuts are planted on about 3.2 mln hectares or one-fourth of total agricultural land."
cominco lead/zinc union rejects contract,zinc lead strategic-metal,"Three United Steelworkers of America locals on strike at Cominco Ltd rejected a tentative three-year contract, a union representative said. ""The vote was 1,229, or 54.5 pct, against, and 1,028, or 45.5 pct, for the contract. Eighty-one pct of the membership voted,"" he said. The union representative said that the pact offered cost of living increases designed to keep pace with inflation, but contained no wage increase. The locals' bargaining committees are expected to meet and prepare for the reopening of negotiations with Cominco, he said. The three locals cover about 2,600 production and maintenance workers at Cominco's Trail smelter and Kimberley, B.C. lead-zinc mine. Output at both sites has been shut down since the production and maintenance workers, along with about 600 office and technical workers, went on strike May 9. The two Steelworkers locals representing the office and technical workers have not negotiated since May 21. The strike caused Cominco to declare force majeure, which means the company may not be able to honor contracts for products from the smelter and mine. Each of the five locals have separate contracts, all of which expired April 30, but the main issues are similar. The union had requested a three pct wage increase in each year of a two-year contract. Cominco had pressed for a three-year contract and some loosening of the rules on job classifications. The Trail smelter, about 400 miles east of Vancouver, produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long tons of lead last year. The Sullivan mine at Kimberley, about 450 miles east of Vancouver, produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year, most for processing at the Trail smelter. The smelter also produced cadmium, bismuth and indium. Revenues from the Trail smelter totalled 356 mln Canadian dlrs in 1986."

The locals' bargaining committees are expected to meet and prepare for the reopening of negotiations with Cominco, he said. The three locals cover about 2,600 production and maintenance workers at Cominco's Trail smelter and Kimberley, B.C. lead-zinc mine. Output at both sites has been shut down since the production and maintenance workers, along with about 600 office and technical workers, went on strike May nine. The two Steelworkers locals representing the office and technical workers have not negotiated since May 21. The strike caused Cominco to declare force majeire, which means the company may not be able to honor contracts for products from the smelter and mine. Each of the five locals have separate contracts, all of which expired April 30, but the main issues are similar. The union had requested a three pct wage increase in each year of a two-year contract. Cominco had pressed for a three-year contract and some loosening of the rules on job classifications. The Trail smelter, about 400 miles east of Vancouver, produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long tons of lead last year. The Sullivan mine at Kimberley, about 450 miles east of Vancouver, produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year, most for processing at the Trail smelter. The smelter also produced cadmium, bismuth and indium. Revenues from the Trail smelter totalled 356 mln Canadian dlrs in 1986."

french say wheat stocks forecast no surprise,grain wheat corn,"The U.S. Department of Agriculture's forecast that French end-of-season soft wheat stocks will almost double in 1987/88 is premature but would not be surprising, according to French cereal organisation officials. The Cereals Intervention Board, ONIC, Wheat Producers' Association and the National Union of Agricultural and Cereal Cooperatives have not yet forecast 1987/88 exports or end-of-season stocks. However, the officials said the USDA's figure of end 1987/88 stocks at 5.03 mln tonnes against 1986/87's 2.87 mln was not surprising given a record high yield forecast in April. The French Feed Cereals Research Institute, ITCF, forecast in mid-April an average yield of 6.58 tonnes per hectare for soft wheat in 1987/88 compared with 5.6 tonnes in 1986/87 and the record high yield of 6.5/6.6 tonnes in 1984. This would result in a French soft wheat harvest of around 31 mln tonnes against 25.5 mln in 1986/87, given a Ministry of Agriculture estimate of area planted of 4.66 mln hectares against 4.61 mln in 1986/87. ONIC's first preliminary forecast of the 1987/88 campaign will be released at the beginning of September, an ONIC official said. Soft wheat exports in 1987/88 were extremely difficult to estimate at this stage, both within the European Community and to non-EC countries, an ONIC official said. He said, however, that among countries to which France could increase its wheat exports were Egypt and the Maghreb countries (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), he said. The USDA's forecast of an 11.65 mln tonne maize crop in 1987/88 against 11.48 mln in 1986/87, while again premature, was not out of line with estimates of the French Maize Producers Association, AGPM, an AGPM official said. Maize plantings would be down in 1987/88 but yields were expected to be higher, the AGPM official said. It estimated 1987/88 maize plantings of 1.73 mln hectares, down seven pct from the 1.87 mln hectares planted in 1986/87."
zambia cuts prices as troops patrol copperbelt,copper sugar grain corn,"The Zambian government today announced minor price cuts for essential commodities as part of its new economic strategy, while police and troops patrolled the northern Copperbelt to prevent any outbreaks of rioting. However, staple foods, such as bread, sugar and maize meal, were not affected by the cuts and many people said this could provoke trouble from disgruntled elements who had expected more sweeping reductions. Observers in the capital expressed disillusionment with the small extent of the price cuts, which ranged up to 10 pct on items such as blankets, soap, detergents and baby food. Residents in the Copperbelt contacted by telephone said government forces had set up roadblocks around the main towns. In Lusaka, business went on as usual and there was no sign of troops or police reinforcements on the streets. President Kaunda had ordered the price reductions to take account of lower import costs following the revaluation of the kwacha to a fixed rate of eight per dlr from 21 on May 1. The revaluation formed part of a new go-it-alone economic strategy which Kaunda adopted to replace Zambia's IMF austerity program. Labour leaders in the Copperbelt said last week gangs of unemployed youths were being formed in the politically volatile region to take action against shops that did not reduce their prices after today's deadline. Fifteen people were killed in the Copperbelt during food riots last December after the government tried to lift maize subsidies."
india plans more bombay offshore oil wells,crude nat-gas,"India's state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) plans to drill more wells in the Bombay offshore area, where a well spudded in February this year gave both oil and gas, an ONGC spokesman said. The exploratory well, spudded at a depth of 2,140 metres, yielded 2,000 barrels of oil and 180,000 cubic metres of gas per day, he said. ""The well, one of the four structures drilled in the area 80 km north-west of Bombay, indicates good prospects of both oil and gas. We've decided to drill at least three more wells in there before starting production on a commercial scale."" Production of Bombay High, part of the Bombay offshore field, has stabilised at around 500,000 barrels per day for the last two years. ONGC produced 27.85 mln tonnes of crude in 1986/87 ending March, up from 27.51 the previous year. Bombay High accounted for 20.61 mln tonnes, marginally up from 20.10 the year before. India's total oil output is around 30 mln tonnes. ONGC has been exploring the Bombay offshore area, developed since the late 1970s, for more oil as production from Bombay High has reached a plateau."
"oklahoma cleaning up after week of floods, rains",grain wheat,"Residents of central Oklahoma returned to their homes over the weekend after a week of heavy rains and severe flooding that left two dead and caused more than 20 mln dlrs in damage, officials said. Some 900 people were evacuated from their homes during the rains and flooding last week, civil defense officials said. Many of the shelters set up throughout the state in areas threatened by flooding, except those near the Washita and Red Rivers, closed as residents returned to their damaged homes. Farmers who had expected a near-record wheat crop now say this year will see one of the largest losses in decades. Gov. Henry Bellmon, who on Thursday declared a flooding emergency for central Oklahoma, was expected to ask President Reagan for federal disaster relief for the area. In northern Texas, officials reported several tornadoes on Friday. A twister in Lubbock yesterday damaged six mobile homes and two houses. No injuries were reported."

Borden said the four companies are expected to have 1987 sales totaling 230 mln dlrs. It said Prince, a Lowell, Mass., producer of pasta and Italian food sauces, is expected to account for 210 mln dlrs of this total. This year's sales of Borden pasta -- by the 13 regional brands and the premium Creamette brand distributed on a nearly national basis -- are expected to toal 285 mln dlrs, it said. Borden said the other three companies being acquired are Steero Bouillon of Jersey City, N.J., Blue Channel Inc, a Beaufort, S.C., producer of canned crabmeat, and the canned shrimp products line of DeJean Packing Inc of Biloxi, Miss. Borden also said the divestment of three operations with about 50 mln dlrs a year in sales is expected to produce nearly 45 mln dlrs in cash for use toward the purchase of new businesses. It said the sale of Polyco of Cincinnati, Ohio, which makes polyvinyl acetate emulsions, to Rohm and Haas Co <ROH> was announced by the buyer last month. Borden said the divestment of two producers of toy models and hobby items -- Heller in France and Humbrol in England -- is in process."
dutch official rate cut seen still likely,interest money-fx dfl dmk,"A cut of about half a percentage point in Dutch official interest rates is still in prospect, although economists said the timing would depend on Bundesbank moves. Speculation has been rife that the Dutch Central Bank, encouraged by a strong guilder/mark relationship and wide premiums for Dutch money and capital market rates over German, might lower rates without the Bundesbank moving first. Last month, the Central Bank lowered its special advances rate to 5.1 pct from 5.25 pct after the Bundesbank dropped its repurchase tender rate to 3.55 pct from 3.8 pct. That rate has remained in force, just holding above the five pct official secured loans rate which governs commercial bank borrowings. Given a strong guilder, a further fall in the West German repo rate would trigger a lower special advances tariff, forcing an official Dutch rate cut, analysts said. In February, when the Bundesbank cut its discount rate to three pct from 3.5 pct, the Central Bank only lowered money market rates and removed a surcharge over the secured loans rate on lending under its three month credit quota. Since then, however, both the Central Bank and Finance Ministry have made it clear they favour lower official rates. In April, Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said he would follow any Bundesbank cut, and last week the Finance Ministry expressed satisfaction when it raised 2.25 billion guilders with a six pct coupon state loan priced at 100.10 pct for an effective yield of 5.98 pct, the lowest since 1965. Technically, analysts said, there has to be a difference between the secured loans rate which applies to lending under the credit quota, and the tariff on special advances which add extra liquidity to the money market. Bank economists and dealers said a West German move to further lower the rate on securities repurchase pacts would result in the Central Bank easing the special advance rate, provided the guilder/mark relationship permitted. The Central Bank aims to keep the guilder stable around its parity value within the European Monetary System of 112.673 guilders per 100 marks. Today, foreign exchange buying pushed the mark up 10 guilder cents to 112.705 guilders per 100 at the fix, a level that would not permit a change in the interest rate differential between West Germany and the Netherlands, dealers said. An economist at ABN Bank said he expected West German and Dutch interest rates to ease in the short term. However, he said new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflation expectations which would put upward pressure on interest rates in the longer term. In the Netherlands, the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil, or even negative, while the latest official economic forecasts point to a falling rate of economic growth. ""It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreement negotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation,"" the ABN economist said. He said Dutch money supply growth, which ran at 3.4 pct in January, could also contribute to some inflation. At Amro Bank, a leading analyst said inflation could run to two pct next year. The bank expects Dutch capital market rates, currently averaging around 6.1 pct, to stop easing in the second half of this year and stabilize around 5.6 pct. Analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buying spree on the bond market which would bring yields down, probably only temporarily, while money rates could fall below five pct. Currently, all periods are traded at 5.12 to 5.25 pct in the money market."
little reaction to comex price limit removal,gold silver,"The elimination of price limits on precious metals contracts trading at the Commodity Exchange in New York appears to be having little effect on the market, analysts said. ""There is nothing apparent from the change,"" said William O'Neill, director of futures research at Elders Futures Inc. ""The market has not approached the old price limits and trading is relative quiet, in narrow ranges,"" he added. Gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs on market moves in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weaker in the nearby contracts amid thin conditions, traders said. On May 5, COMEX did away with price limits on the two contracts following spot after a volatile market in silver futures at the end of April caused severe disruptions. During the last week of April, silver futures traded up and down the price limit in the back months, causing traders to rush into the spot contract to offset those moves, analysts said. As a result, Elders' O'Neill said, there was much confusion, many unmatched trades, and large losses. The COMEX fined Elders Futures and three other large firms a total of 100,000 dlrs for failure to resolve unmatched trades in a timely manner. Silver futures were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the nearby contracts amid quiet trading today. O'Neill said the elimination of price limits on all COMEX metals futures would add caution to trading since all contracts could move any distance. ""This is amore realistic approach because the metals market is a 24 hours market and prices can move without limit,"" O'Neill said. Paul Cain, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers, said the elimination of price limits will cut back on panic buying or selling and contribute to more orderly markets."
u.s. gulf of mexico rig count climbs to 38.9 pct,nat-gas crude,"Utilization of offshore mobile rigs in the Gulf of Mexico climbed by 2.1 pct last week to 38.9 pct, reflecting a total of 91 working rigs, Offshore Data Services said. One year ago, the Gulf of Mexico utilization rate was 32.5 pct. Offshore Data Services said some drilling contractors had reported recent increases of about 1,000 dlrs a day on large jackup rigs, which now command rates of 11,000 to 12,000 dlrs a day. In the European/Mediterranean area the rig utilization rate rose 0.6 pct to 53.6 pct, against 67.3 pct one year ago.

"u.s. trade bill very dangerous for canada, lobby",trade lumber,"A trade bill before the United States House of Representatives ""is a very dangerous bill for Canadian industry,"" Canadian Forest Industry Council chairman Adam Zimmerman told reporters. By changing the definition of subsidy under U.S. countervailing duty law, House of Representatives Bill 3 removes protection for companies that take advantage of widely used government programs, Zimmerman told a media briefing. ""Clearly, any industry to which Canadian governments grant rights to fish, mine, cut timber, or produce power could be vulnerable to a finding of a subsidy under this language,"" he said. The Canadian forest lobby's Zimmerman also said the House of Representative Bill would adopt a new way of measuring subsidies that would greatly increase the size of any countervailing duties that might be imposed on Canadian resource exports to the U.S. Under the bill, any difference between Canadian prices and U.S. or world market prices would constitute a subsidy, he said. Such a method would make Canadian resource industries vulnerable to similar penalties like a 15 pct export tax imposed last January on shipments of Canadian softwood lumber to the U.S., Zimmerman added. Canadian negotiators agreed to levy the new tax if a U.S. forest industry lobby would drop its request for a countervail duty on imports of Canadian softwood lumber. ""We represent the first victim of the move to price other countries' natural resources according to the U.S. system,"" Zimmerman said. ""If we're an example, than other resource industries had better watch out,"" he added. Zimmerman said the Canadian Forest Industry Council plans to discuss concerns about the U.S. trade bill with lobby groups from other Canadian resource industries."
little reaction to removal comex daily limits,gold silver copper alum,"The elimination of limits on daily price fluctuations for metals futures contracts traded on the Commodity Exchange, COMEX, appears to be having little effect on the market, analysts said. ""There is nothing apparent from the change,"" said William O'Neill, director of futures research at Elders Futures Inc. ""The market has not approached the old price limits and trading is relative quiet, in narrow ranges,"" he said. On May 5, COMEX eliminated price limits on the two contracts following each spot delivery in gold, silver, copper and aluminum futures after a review of its clearing operations, which were severely tested by a volatile market in silver futures at the end of April. COMEX announced Friday the lifting of all daily limits, effective today. Gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs per ounce in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weaker in the nearby contracts amid thin volume conditions, traders said. Silver futures, previously limited at 50 cents in most back months, were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the nearby contracts amid quiet trading today. During the last week of April, silver futures often traded at the daily allowable limit amid concerns about inflation, the dollar, and other factors. Traders rushed into the spot, or unlimited, contract to offset those moves, analysts said. As a result, O'Neill said, there was much confusion, many unmatched trades, and large losses for some traders. The COMEX fined four large firms a total of 100,000 dlrs for failure to resolve unmatched trades in a timely manner.

reagan hints u.s. wants help in patrolling gulf,ship crude,"President Reagan said he would discuss the Mideast Gulf situation with allied leaders at next week's Venice economic summit and hinted he would seek their help in preserving free navigation. In a speech prepared for delivery as the United States made plans to protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers from Iranian attack, Reagan said the American people were aware that ""it is not our interests alone that are being protected."" Saying that allied dependence on gulf oil was no secret, Reagan declared, ""During the upcoming summit in Venice, we will be discussing the common security interests shared by the western democracies in the MIDEAST Gulf. ""The future belongs to the brave. Free men should not cower before such challenges, and they should not expect to stand alone."" Reagan will meet the leaders of Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan at the economic summit, which will take place in Venice June 8-10. The 13th annual top-level meeting of the major industrial democracies will take place against a backdrop of rising congressional concern over Reagan's plan to protect gulf shipping and demands that the allies do more. These concerns were heightened by the May 17 Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark which killed 37 seamen. ""They died while guarding a chokepoint of freedom, deterring aggression and reaffirming America's willingness to protect its vital interests,"" Reagan said. In a pre-summit speech celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Marshall Plan, Reagan, who spoke to an audience of foreign affairs experts, also pledged to push for economic expansion by West Germany and Japan to bolster the world trading system. ""While the vibrancy of the U.S. economy has contributed enormously to the world expansion, preserving a growing world economy is the business of every member of the world trading community,"" he said. ""It will be made clear, especially to our friends in Japan and the Federal Republic of Germany, that growth-oriented domestic policies are needed to bolster the world trading system on which they depend."" Reagan coupled this appeal with a call for compliance with allied accords on exchange rate stability. ""Economic policy decisions made last year in Tokyo and at this year's meetings of Group of Seven finance ministers in Paris and in Washington cannot be ignored or forgotten,"" he said. ""The commitments made at these meetings need to be translated into action."""

u.s. trade data seen as key to dollar trend,money-fx dlr trade,"The dollar's recent signs of stability have raised hopes that its 27-month decline may be nearly over, but most currency analysts refuse to commit themselves until after the June 12 release of U.S. trade data for April. ""The trade data will be a deciding factor to see if the dollar has bottomed out,"" said Jim McGroarty of Discount Corp. Since February 1985, the dollar has nearly halved its value against the yen and the mark as part of an officially orchestrated campaign to make U.S. goods more competitive on world markets and redress gaping world trade imbalances. On April 27, the dollar fell to a 40-year low of 137.25 yen but has enjoyed a modest recovery over the last few weeks, topping 145 yen today for the first time in nearly two months. Many economists now believe that the dollar has fallen far enough to ease the trade deficit's drag on the U.S. economy. The U.S. trade gap narrowed to 13.6 billion dlrs in March from 15.1 billion in February and is expected to show continued improvement in April in volume, if not in real, terms. Keiichi Udagawa of Bank of Tokyo in New York said that if further progress is reported, the dollar would head back up towards 150 yen. ""There is growing consensus that the dollar has bottomed out for the medium term,"" added Tom Campbell of First National Bank of Chicago. Other factors supporting this bullish view were growing expectations that Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker would be reappointed for a third four-year term in August, Japan's larger-than-expected economic stimulus package last week and more favorably technical chart signals, analysts said. The dollar was also aided by Japan's moves to dampen speculative selling in Tokyo and by reports of active central bank intervention to support the dollar. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said last week that the U.S. monetary authorities bought more than four billion dlrs during the February-April period -- the largest amount since the dollar crisis of the late 1970's. Discount Corp's McGroarty described the Fed's intervention volume as ""impressive"". James O'Neill of Marine Midland Bank was not so positive, however: ""the dollar has not yet bottomed out. After the trade data are released, the dollar could fall towards 1.77 marks and 140 yen."" Similarly, Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank in New York warned, ""I don't think the dollar has bottomed out yet."" Although the dollar could rise as high as 146.50 yen, Okada said market impatience about the painstakingly slow decline of the U.S. trade deficit may lead to renewed pressure. Currency analysts also warned about an unfavorable reaction to the seven-nation economic Summit on June 8 to 10 in Venice, which is likely to focus on the implementation of previous commitments rather than yield any fresh initiatives. President Reagan said today, ""economic policy decisions made last year in Tokyo and at this year's meetings of Group of Seven finance ministers in Paris and Washington cannot be ignored or forgotten."" ""The commitments made at these meetings need to be translated into action,"" he added in a speech, celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Marshall aid plan for Europe. Now that Tokyo has unveiled its fiscal stimulus package, analysts expected Bonn and the dollar/mark rate to bear the brunt of U.S. calls for further action. Marine Midland's O'Neill said, ""pressure will build up on Germany to take stimulative action like Japan."" Some Japanese bank dealers warned that although the dollar could hold above 145 yen for some months it could also come under attack again if it seems the latest economic package is not having much impact on Japan's economy and its trade surplus. Reflecting a longer-term uncertainty, some some trust banks and Japanese insurers are keeping their short dollar positons hedged against exchange losses in their foreign portfolios, while some others have started covering those short positions, Japanese bank dealers said."
no reason to cut rates - bundesbank's schlesinger,interest gnp,"Bundesbank vice president Helmut Schlesinger said he saw no reason to lower interest rates now. With money supply growth showing no sign of slowing down in May and the dollar stable or even rising against the mark, Schlesinger told Reuters that he was not convinced that a further cut in interest rates was needed. The economy is picking up, after contracting by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter from the fourth, he added. ""We may have an increase in gnp starting in the second quarter,"" he said in an interview. Concerned by the first quarter downturn, the U.S. Has been pressing West Germany to pump up its economy and boost its imports, either through fiscal or monetary policy. Schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter was mainly due to adverse weather conditions, just as occured in 1986. Year-on-year growth was thus about two pct. He estimated that economic growth for the year as a whole would probably be between one and two pct. ""It is not a question of monetary conditions if domestic demand does not grow strongly,"" he said, noting that interest rates are at historically low levels and funds are ample. Schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank money stock growth was slowing down from its recent year-on-year pace of 7-1/2 to eight pct, well above the Bundesbank's three to six pct target. He said the target could still be achieved but much will depend on the direction of long-term capital flows. Heavy inflows, particularly in January around the time of the EMS revaluation, boosted domestic money supply. ""There is still a certain hope that the net inflow of foreign money can be diminished or can even be a little bit reversed,"" Schlesinger said. A major reason for the inflows was the market's conviction that the mark was headed higher. ""As we can see from the market, expectations for a further revaluation of the deutschemark have diminished,"" Schlesinger said. The recent widening of interest rate differentials, the fact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short period and an improvement in real trade balances have all combined towards stabilizing the dollar, he said. Asked if central banks might act to prevent a sharp dollar rise, as the U.S. Did in March when the dollar rose above 1.87 marks, he said this would depend on the circumstances. At midday here, the dollar stood at 1.8340/45 marks. ""Central banks are always in contact about these fluctuations but I cannot give any answer how they would react,"" Schelsinger said. ""One has to look at how it (the market) is moving,"" he said, adding, ""It is not only our own case, it is also the American case."" He said that the West German export industry has been hit hard by the dollar's sharp fall and would probably like to see some correction now. ""But it wouldn't be good to have short-term fluctuations,"" he said. ""Let us wait and see."" ""It is mainly the strength of the (dollar) fall in a very short period which was a little bit of a shock, than the level (of rates) as such,"" Schlesinger said. The sharp rise of the mark, coupled with weak prices of such key commodities as oil, had a favourable impact on West German inflation down year. Although there have recently been signs of inflation picking up, he said that this was due to changes in key commodity prices. The underlying inflation rate this year would be unchanged, at about one to 1-1/2 pct, he said. Schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growth was longer term, in that the economy was building up the potential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation. The above-target growth of money supply over the past 16 months had prompted some discussion of the usefulness of targets themselves, a matter which might be taken up at the mid-year meeting of the Bundesbank's council, Schlesigner said. But he added: ""I don't see any great pressure to go away from it."""
japan oil industry decontrol may lead to mergers,crude acq,"Deregulation of Japan's oil industry could mean hardship for smaller firms and lead to their merging into bigger refining and marketing groups, industry sources said. They said the relaxation of controls was now under review by the Petroleum Council, an advisory panel to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI). A spokesman for a major firm said, ""Deregulation would bring about a reorganization. If it's a by-product of freer competition, we have no choice but to accept it."" The Council is due to close its discussions on June 12. The sources said the Council was likely to tell MITI it should end its 50 year-old protection of the industry. It should cut capacity to 3.8 mln barrels per day, about 75 pct of current capacity. Quotas should end for crude throughput and gasoline output, and oil tariffs should be abolished. They said deregulation was vital to promote more competition and efficiency, and most saw it as inevitable. ""Deregulation is taking place everywhere. Now it's our turn to see if we can survive cut-throat competition,"" said a source at one major Japanese oil company. A spokesman for a smaller refiner said, ""We'll have a hard time surviving, but that's something we must go through."" ""In addition to our streamlining and efficiency programs for the oil division, we will exert efforts towards branching out further into other lines such as real estate and travel agencies,"" he said. Larger companies are also streamlining. Nippon Oil Co Ltd which had the largest share of refined products sales in the Japanese market in fiscal 1985, cut nine pct of its refining capacity in fiscal 1986. Cosmo Oil Co Ltd, the third largest seller of oil products in 1985, cut its workforce by some 20 pct last year, a spokesman for the company said. Between 1984 and 1986, on the recommendation of the Council, 13 oil companies were integrated into 11 companies within seven refining and marketing groups to improve the efficiency of the industry. Oil industry sources said this structure was now likely to be streamlined further into five refining groups. ""MITI means business. It will urge the major seven groups to merge into five to build up their muscles,"" a source said. A MITI official told Reuters he did not rule out the possibility of further mergers within the Japanese oil industry in the event of the relaxation of oil controls. He declined to officially confirm or deny that the Petroleum Council had recommended deregulatory measures but said that in principal MITI would encourage a move towards deregulation."
japan ready to use diplomacy for gulf security,ship crude,"Japan was ready to use diplomacy to help maintain the security of the Gulf, Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said. But he told reporters Japan should not cut its lines of communication with Iran and Iraq because its policy was to take a broad political stance. Officials of the foreign ministry said Japan had maintained good relations with both Iran and Iraq, which have been at war since September 1980. Last week Nakasone ruled out Japanese military or financial help to patrol the waters of the Gulf. About 60 pct of Japan's crude oil passes through the waterway. President Reagan said yesterday the threat to oil routes in the Gulf from attacks by Iran and Iraq was high on the agenda for next week's G-7 summit in Venice. Reagan has approved plans for the United States to step up its naval presence in the Gulf despite congressional expressions of concern and he has called on U.S. Allies to help maintain freedom of navigation. Japan's constitution prevents its armed forces from being deployed overseas. Nakasone has said that Washington understands this problem."

Total Exploration had interests ranging from 18.75 to 25 pct in four blocks in permit ATP259P in south-west Queensland, Santos said in a statement. The Santos group stakes will rise to between 52.5 and 70 pct of the four ATP259P blocks as a result of the purchase. The price was not disclosed. Santos said a number of oil and gas fields have been discovered in the Total Exploration areas and that it regards them as having very good prospects for further discoveries. Total's reserves amount to 75 billion cubic feet of gas and 5.5 mln barrels of oil and condensate, it said. It said it will promote a vigorous exploration program in the areas for the rest of 1987 and in the future. The acquisition is the latest in a series by Santos as part of a program to expand from its origins in the South Australian Cooper Basin."

The central bank said the lower surplus was mainly due to the decline in the value of exports and re-exports to 37.2 billion dirhams from 54.2 billion in 1985. This reflected the decline in oil prices last year and difficulties in marketing UAE oil, the central bank added.

"bomb threats, strikes as fiji sees end trade ban",grain wheat rice,"Fiji today welcomed the ending of a trade ban imposed by Australian labor unions as supporters of the country's ousted prime minister Timoci Bavadra renewed pressure for his reinstatement with strikes and shop closures. The government welcomed a decision by the Australian Waterside Workers' Federation to lift its ban on shipments to Fiji, imposed in support of Bavadra, whose newly-elected government was overthrown in a military coup on May 14. The ban had threatened food shortages of imported wheat, fresh vegetables and medicines. A direct result of the union decision would be the immediate shipment of 9,000 tons of rice and wheat from an Australian port, the government said. Shops in Nadi and Lautoka, center of the country's sugar industry, closed again today in support of Bavadra. In Nadi two bomb threats forced evacuation of the Australian Westpac bank, but police said they turned out to be a hoax. Bavadra has launched a campaign of civil disobedience to press for his reinstatement."
u.k. reserves lift hopes of further base rate cut,reserves interest,"The record 4.9 billion dlrs rise in U.K. Reserves in May to a total 34.7 billion has lifted hopes for a further cut in bank base lending rates after the June 11 general election, market analysts said. Sterling would have risen on the much better than expected number but for market nerves about the poll outcome, they said. But the weight of foreign currency and gold reserves now available to the authorities to support the pound should curb any market tendency to panic if U.K. Opinion polls show the ruling Conservative Party's lead slipping, they added. ""We have been intervening to a very much greater extent than we have done hitherto,"" Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said at a news conference today, commenting on the news of the record reserves rise. He put the U.K. Intervention in the context of the Louvre accord between leading industrial nations to stabilise the dollar, partly through direct intervention on foreign exchanges. ""We have been playing a very full part ourselves,"" he said. But market analysts see the recent upward pressure on sterling, and consequent need for official sales to damp down its rise, more in the light of local factors. Steven Bell, chief economist at Morgan Grenfell Securities, said that corporate money has been flowing back into Britain amid hopes of another Conservative government, after fears last autumn of a Labour election victory sent it flooding out. U.K. Portfolio investment is also returning, while foreign buyers see U.K. Growth propects and high bond yields as attractive. They will be strong buyers of U.K. Assets, notably equities, once the election is out of the way, Bell said. Analysts see this pressure as the main hope for lower interest rates, as the government is expected to try to reverse the loss of export competitiveness caused by a strong pound. Today, however, the pound hardly moved on the reserves news, dipping on its trade-weighted index against a basket of currencies from 73.1 pct of its 1975 value at 1000 GMT to 73.0 pct at 1100 GMT, half an hour after the figures were released. ""The market doesn't want to do anything because of the election,"" commented an economist at a big U.S. Investment bank. Several dealers and analysts added that market forecasts of a rise in reserves of between one and three billion dlrs had overestimated the amount of pound sales that were likely to have been disguised by swap arrangements or transactions on the forward market. The market also seemed to have overestimated the amount of sterling the Bank of England bought at the end of May to smooth the pound's sudden downturn, while some of the intervention reported in May probably occurred in April, they said. The key three months interbank money market rates eased about 1/8 point, reflecting cautious hopes that the downtrend in U.K. Interest rates will be revived following the reserves news, analysts said. Government bond prices initially firmed, but the market was muted as traders worried about the funding implications of another huge rise in reserves, they added. Morgan Grenfell's Bell forecast a half point base rate cut from the current nine pct level soon after the election, so long as poll projections of another Conservative victory prove accurate, with another half point later. Justin Silverton, equity economist at Credit Suisse Buckmaster and Moore, said a full point reduction might be possible. ""Sterling will be held down by interest rate cuts in future, rather than this active intervention,"" he predicted. Kevin Boakes of Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged cautioned against over-optimistic forecasts, but agreed a half point cut looked likely. A cut before the election has been virtually ruled out. ""The Bank (of England) is both worried about the political problem of cutting rates during an election campaign ... And has signalled some worry about broad money (growth),"" said Robin Marshall, chief U.K. Economist at Chase Manhattan Securities. He said the 10 billion dlrs increase in total reserves in the past seven months may foreshadow full U.K. Entry into the European Monetary System. But Bell said the authorities would like to see another 10 or 15 billion dlrs in the reserves before joining, if they did so. But, unlike many analysts, he doubted the U.K. Will go in."
s.africa expected to unveil expansionary budget,cpi gnp,"South Africa is expected to unveil tomorrow an expansionary budget for the second consecutive year in a bid to boost the nation's flagging economic growth rate, economic analysts said. Faced with competing demands for increased military and police spending and the pressing need for more funds for black housing and education, Finance Minister Barend Du Plessis is expected to raise significantly the government's overall expenditure targets when he presents the budget to parliament, the analysts said. Analysts expect Du Plessis to provide for a rise in state spending at least equal to the 16 pct inflation rate for the financial year that started on April 1, while ignoring pleas from the private sector to stimulate growth by cutting taxes. ""Fiscal policy has become gradually more expansionary, but simply raising government spending and increasing the budget deficit is an inflationary form of stimulation,"" said Rob Lee, chief economist at South African Mutual Life Assurance Co. South Africa this year is targeting inflation-adjusted growth in GDP of three pct against an increase last year of less than one pct. Growth in GDP over the past decade has averaged about 1.5 pct, while the unemployment rate among blacks has spiralled to over 30 pct. Economists estimate that the government's spending target will rise to about 47 billion rand, with revenue budgeted at around 40 billion rand. This would leave a budget deficit before borrowing of about seven billion rand, or four pct of GDP. The government, having consistently overshot its own spending targets for more than a decade, also faces a credibility crisis over expenditure figures outlined in the budget, analysts said. ""The budget is invariably too optimistic on expenditure,"" said Standard Bank Ltd in a budget preview. Many analysts in the private sector are now paying less attention to the figures presented in the budget and are using their own estimates of expenditure to draw conclusions for the money and capital markets. South African Mutual's Lee believes government spending will again exceed the budget target and increase to around 49 billion rand this year, leaving a deficit of between 5 and 5.5 pct of GDP, compared with a three pct limit suggested by the IMF. ""The IMF limit is obviously going to be abandoned,"" predicted one analyst, noting that South Africa has moved steadily away from austerity measures recommended by the IMF over the past two years. The policy shift followed a dramatic deterioration in the political situation and the onset of an economic crisis triggered by the refusal of major foreign banks to roll over loans to the country in September 1985. Against a background of Western economic sanctions, falling per capita incomes, rising joblessness and high inflation, government officials say economic growth is the prime objective. But private-sector economists caution that the government's ability to promote growth by boosting state spending is constrained by the need to maintain a large surplus on the current account of the country's balance of payments. Most of that surplus, this year estimated at around 2.5 billion dlrs, will be swallowed up by repayments on the nation's estimated 23 billion dlr foreign debt in terms of an arrangement reached earlier this year with major international creditor banks. Within these constraints, economists believe Du Plessis has little room to manoeuvre. Analysts argue recent rises in civil service salaries and budgeted spending increases for the state-owned Post Office and South African Transport Services suggest that major tax concessions to individuals or corporations are unlikely. Du Plessis earlier this year announced small concessions for taxpayers in a mini-budget before the May 6 whites-only election. The poll delayed presentation of the national budget. ""This will not be a very exciting budget,"" commented Harry Schwarz, spokesman on finance for the liberal Progressive Federal Party. ""I do not expect any major tax cuts as all the sweets were given out before the election."""

italian barley crop reported in good condition,grain barley,"Italy's barley crop is generally in good condition and harvesting is expected to begin shortly, the agricultural marketing information and research board Irvam said. First consignments were expected to be available around mid-June. Excellent weather, characterised by alternating periods of sunshine and rain, has encouraged growth except in Sardinia, which was expected to lose a large part of its barley crop because of extreme dryness. Irvam said yields are expected higher than last year's low levels if favourable weather continues in the next few weeks. Given an average yield of 3.5 tonnes per hectare, national production would be around two pct higher than in the previous season at just above 1.6 mln tonnes, it said. If yields reach the record 3.78 tonnes per hectare achieved in 1984, production would be around 1.75 mln tonnes, an increase of 11 pct compared to 1986."
u.s. house panel votes to speed up corn payments,grain corn,"The House Agriculture Committee voted to make approximately 2.8 billion dlrs of feedgrains deficiency payments immediately instead of in the late fall. A similar measure was decisively defeated on the Senate floor last week. The bill, which passed by a voice vote, would allow so-called Findley payments to be made immediately rather than late this year. Payments for 1987-90 feedgrains crops would not be changed. Because the bill would move 2.8 billion dlrs of spending into fiscal 1987 from fiscal 1988, the measure is expected to meet stiff resistance in the full House."

bundesbank credit policy changes unlikely,interest money-fx,"The Bundesbank is unlikely to change credit policies when its central bank council meets on Thursday for its last session before the Venice summit, banking economists and money market dealers said. The Bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month by cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts, and is unlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest rates in the near future, they said. The council will meet in Saarbruecken, and the meeting will be followed by a news conference at around 1030 GMT. But Bundesbank officials noted that a news conference was usually called when the council meets outside Frankfurt, and did not necessarily herald any policy moves. Bundesbank Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger said today there was no reason to cut interest rates because money supply growth had shown no signs of slowing in May and the dollar was stable against the mark. Schlesinger told Reuters in Tokyo, where the Bundesbank has opened a representative office, that the West German economy was now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter. Money market dealers said call money was likely to hold in a 3.50/70 pct range for most of this month, after the Bundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at a minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, allocating funds at 3.55 pct. ""They have set this signal and indicated they could maybe lower market rates even further, but not with the discount or Lombard,"" Winfried Hutmann, chief economist of Schroeder, Munchmeyer, Hengst Investment GmbH said. Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said German rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and around historical lows for West Germany. A further cut in rates would have little impact on the economy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand, with companies swimming in liquidity, Chrobok said. The Bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a move on interest rates, when this would be better held in reserve. ""The Bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder,"" he said. A cut in the discount or Lombard rates, to bring them in line with the new structure of money market rates since last month, would have little practical significance, dealers said. The Bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted a diplomatic gesture before next week's Venice summit. But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl has often made it clear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere ""eyewash."" Economists said it was really up to the Bonn government to cut taxes, rather than for the Bundesbank to ease monetary policy, to meet pressure on West Germany at the Venice summit. But with Bonn struggling to finance already announced tax cuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budget deficit, it is hard to see how Bonn could cut taxes further. ""The Bonn government will be in a very weak position in Venice because they can't risk increasing the deficit further,"" said Schroeder, Muenchmeyer, Hengst's Hutmann. Bethmann's Chrobok said if anything is to happen before Venice, it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy. ""But I don't expect any convincing measures,"" he said. Money market dealers noted that call money continued to normalize today, falling to 3.60/70 pct from 3.75/85 yesterday and as much as five pct on Friday when it was pushed up by month-end distortions. Call money could come under upwards pressure later this month because of a major round of tax payments by banks on behalf of customers, starting in the week beginning June 15. Two public holidays that week could also distort the market. Dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to allocate funds tomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 3.55 pct, after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, and to fully replace the 5.5 billion marks in an outgoing pact. But dealers said it was possible the Bundesbank would allocate funds at 3.6 pct rather than 3.55. That would not represent a tightening of policy, however. Because the Bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates at the minimum accepted rate, some banks may try to get a full allocation by bidding heavily at 3.6 pct, dealers said. On another issue, Poehl has said the Bundesbank is likely to lift restrictions on private use of the European Currency Unit (ECU) at one of its meetings soon. Saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcement on this gesture to European unity, as it is the capital of the Saarland bordering France, and was twice under French occupation this century. But dealers said an ECU announcement was unlikely to come this week, as a number of technical and legal matters had still to be resolved, for instance how German ECU accounts would be treated for minimum reserve purposes."
tight far east freight space hits sugar market,ship sugar,"The Far Eastern sugar market is being hit by a tightening in available nearby freight space needed to move raw sugar to various destinations, notably from Thailand, traders said. This has resulted in a hardening of freight rates in those areas. These are now being quoted between 12.5 and 17.5 dlrs a tonne per day, depending on shipment and destination, against recent fixings below 12 dlrs a tonne. Charterers are considering combining contracted shipments because of inadequate space, shipping sources said, noting 13 raws cargoes are awaiting shipment from various ports. A cargo of Thai raw sugar was reported traded at basis July New York futures less 25 points for June/July 15 shipment, traders said. But others said this was old business."
leutwiler wants firmer mark against sfr,money-fx sfr dmk,"Fritz Leutwiler, chairman of BBC AG Brown Boveri und Cie and a former Swiss National Bank president, urged the National Bank to declare its intent of achieving a rising rate for the mark against the Swiss franc. In a speech to shareholders, Leutwiler said, ""A gradually rising rate for the mark in relation to the franc would be desirable from the standpoint of industrial exports and with regard to sustaining Swiss industry."" ""Simply an appropriate declaration of intent by our bank of issue (Swiss National Bank) could have a positive effect,"" he said. Leutwiler, who served 10 years as head of the Swiss central bank, said such a step would not contradict the National Bank's target of monetary stability. ""Bringing the franc close to the mark would, of course, have to be done step by step under the watchful eye of monetary policy,"" he told shareholders. ""Realistically there is in fact no persuasive reason why the German currency is quoted almost 20 pct lower than the Swiss."" A National Bank spokesman said the relation of the mark and Swiss franc was an example of stable currency parities over a long period of time. The spokesman said exchange rates were made by the market, not the central bank, and it would be impossible to influence individual parities separately. Leutwiler said the Swiss National Bank could not support the value of the dollar, even in conjunction with other central banks, without putting monetary stability in jeopardy. ""I would be the last to recommend that. The key to a stronger dollar lies in the United States itself,"" Leutwiler said."
"volcker departure revives dlr, inflation fears",money-fx interest dlr,"Paul Volcker's decision not to go for a third term as Federal Reserve Chairman and the nomination of Alan Greenspan to replace him have revived deep concerns about the U.S.' ability to prevent a further dollar decline and stem rising inflation, financial market analysts said. Although Greenspan is known as a committed anti-inflation fighter in the Volcker mould, doubts are already surfacing in the U.S. financial markets as to whether he has enough political clout and monetary experience to wage a tough campaign against inflation over the next year or two. ""The critical issue is how (Greenspan) will deal with inflation,"" said Stephen Axilrod, Vice Chairman of Nikko Securities Co International Inc and former staff director for monetary and financial policy at the Fed. ""A lot of questions have been raised by Volcker's departure. Until Greenspan answers them, the markets will remain nervous,"" added Stephen Slifer, money market economist at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc. This morning's announcement sent the dollar into a tailspin, which was halted only by concerted central bank intervention in the open currency market."
small rise seen in u.s. gasoline inventories,gas crude,"U.S. analysts expect the American Petroleum Institute's weekly report on oil inventories to show a slight build in U.S. stocks of gasoline for the week ended May 29, oil traders and analysts said. While the consensus is for an increase, a few would not rule out the possibility of an decline. Traders said that barring any surprises in tonight's report, they expect the report to be neutral to bearish for oil prices. Heating oil stocks are also likely to build and runs to be steady to slightly higher, which could add pressure on oil prices, the analysts said. Crude oil was seen likely to build assuming imports continue at relatively high levels. Analysts expect gasoline stocks to rise 500,000 to two mln barrels above the 234 mln reported for May 22. Peter Beutel, oil analyst with Elders Futures inc, who looks for a build said, ""We have had five weeks of gasoline demand at 7.3 mln bpd or more and it is likely to taper off to between 6.7-7.0 mln bpd, which should make stocks build. Demand would have to stay above 7.0 mln bpd to have a draw,"" he added. Rising demand is why oil traders and analysts expect a draw in stocks of about of about one mln barrels. The U.S. Energy Information Administration in its latest report for the four weeks ending may 22 said that gasoline demand was up 4.4 pct to 7.3 mln bpd from the previous year. But analysts said hopes of reduced stocks is likely to founder on increased runs in refineries, which could be up 0.3 pct above May 22's 81.2 pct capacity operated. Such an increase would raise runs about 100,000 bpd and add to U.S. stocks. But some analysts said that refiners may have held refinery runs. Heating oil stocks were also expected to build between 700,000 barrels and one mln from the 96 mln barrel level reported last week, but a rise in distillate stocks was discounted as having a market impact at this time. ""A build is seasonal now and not out of line with last year,"" one futures analyst said. Analysts said they also expect crude oil stocks to build between 1.5 mln barrels and three mln from the 325 mln barrels reported by API for the week of may 22. The consensus appears for about two mln barrels to be added to the nation's inventory."
soycomplex could rally on tight u.s. feed supply,oilseed soybean soy-meal meal-feed,"Nearby months in soybean and soymeal futures could post a short-term rally on tightening supply of livestock feed, even if favorable growing conditions keep the new crop outlook bearish, traders said. ""A lot of soymeal dealers are just getting very worried about where processors will get their soybeans this Summer,"" one Illinois soyproduct dealer said. Processors are competing vigorously with river dealers for the few soybeans being offered by country elevators, with a Decatur, Illinois processor raising its spot soybean basis bid another two cents today to 10 over July futures. Farmer marketings of old crop soybeans continue very light, with flat prices apparently well below levels they are willing to sell, dealers said. Some terminal elevator operators are coming to the belief that even if futures rally back to last month's highs, country movement may remain light because farmers in many areas are sold out of old crop soybeans, particularly in the eastern half of the Midwest. Soybean processors will continue to take seasonal downtime for maintenance if soybeans remain difficult to buy, reducing the weekly soybean crush rate still further and keeping the spot soymeal basis strong, dealers said. Futures traders said tight cash supplies should help July soybeans and soymeal gain on deferreds. July soymeal has already moved to a premium over the August through October months and old crop July/new crop November soybeans may also move to a July premium later this month, they added."
kaufman says greenspan nomination bad for bonds,interest money-fx,"Henry Kaufman, managing director of Salomon Brothers Inc, said the nomination of economist Alan Greenspan to replace Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker is bearish in the near term for the fixed income and currency markets. ""The basic direction of interest rates is not changed. The fundamental direction of interest rates continues to be upward, interrupted by intermittent rallies,"" Kaufman said in a statement. He said the implication for equity markets in neutral to bullish. Kaufman said, ""Unlike Paul Volcker, who entered the office of the Federal Reserve chairman with strong credibility both domestically and internationally, Mr Greenspan will have to demonstrate both his competence and policy independence before he can gain full confidence of the financial markets."" Greenspan is most knowledgeable on the behavior of the U.S. economy, while his professional skills in the international area are much more limited, Kaufman noted. ""Consequently, although he is well known abroad, his views on issues such as the Less Developed Country Debt may initially carry less weight than have those of Mr Volcker."""
overseas <osg> sees opec quotas key to rates,ship crude,"Overseas Shipholding Group Inc president Morton Hyman said if oil production by OPEC rises during the second half of 1987, freight rates for tankers should rise accordingly. Hyman, delivering a speech at the annual shareholders meeting, said international tanker markets were generally weak throughout the first quarter, but since the end of March OPEC oil production has picked up. The result has been a modest improvement in tanker rates. Overseas said 73 pct of its fleet handles liquid cargo. He said tanker requirements decreased in September 1986 as OPEC production quotas dropped and levels of oil stocks rose. For the first quarter 1987, the company reported net income of 10.3 mln dlrs, or 40 cts per share, compared to 9.3 mln dlrs, or 36 cts per share, for the comparable quarter a year ago. The company reported net income for 1986 of 37.3 mln dlrs, or 1.45 dlrs per share. ""The improvement in the company's 1986 results, after four years of declining earnings, reflects a sharp, albeit temporary, rise in freight rates in the international tanker markets last summer,"" Hyman said. He said the Alaskan oil trade continues to be the principal source of employment for its U.S. flag tanker fleet, which represents approximately 15 pct of the company's tonnage. Overseas owns and operates 67 vessels."
ccc accepts bonus on barley to saudi arabia,grain barley,"The Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC, has accepted bids for export bouses to cover sales of 150,000 tonnes of U.S. barley to Saudi Arabia, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. The CCC accepted three bonus offers from one exporter which averaged 40.88 dlrs per tonne, it said. The barley is for delivery August 15-November 30 in three shiments of 50,000 tonnes each. The bonus awards were made to Louis Dreyfus Corporation and will be paid in the form of commodities from CCC stocks. An additional 350,000 tonnes of U.S. barley are still available to Saudi Arabia under the Export Enhancement Program initiative annnounced on May 15, 1987, it said."
usda sets 0/92 provision for some producers,grain wheat,"Some producers in the 1987 acreage reduction program may be eligible for deficiency payments on 92 pct of their enrolled acreage even though none of it is planted with wheat or other program crops, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. The department said the provision of the Farm Disaster Assistance Act will be available to all eligible winter wheat producers, producers of other types of wheat who were prevented from planting their 1987 wheat crop because of a 1986 natural disaster, and all producers who operate farms with program crop acreage bases subject to flooding on 50 pct of such crop's permitted acreage. A producer who did not enroll in the 1987 acreage reduction program may become eligible by signing-up no later than July 15. Producers will be informed by the local offices when applications are being accepted, it said. The department said producers of wheat other than winter wheat may use the 0/92 option if they were preventedf from planting their intended acreage with wheat for harvest in 1987 because of any natural disasters which occured in 1986 or if the farm is located in a county approved by Farmers Home Administration for emergency loans for such disasters that occurred in 1986."
u.s. wheat in senegal market -- usda,grain wheat,"After a highly favorable reception of a trial batch of bread baked from 300 lbs of U.S. wheat flour last February, the Senegalese appear ready to take delivery of a first tranche of 10,500 tonnes of mixed U.S. wheat, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. In its report on U.S. Export Markets for U.S. Grain, the department noted Senegal had bought 100,000 tonnes of wheat under the Export Enhancement Program last November, but local opposition from millers, accustomed to French wheat, has been delaying deliveries. As a result there were a series of baking seminars as well as the trial batch, in an effort to satisfy local flour millers and convince key officials of the qualities of U.S. wheat. The department said if deliveries of U.S. wheat to Senegal remain on track, the U.S. could dominate a wheat market that had been expected to import 140,000 tonnes of mostly French wheat during the 1987/88 (July-June) season."
rains aid manitoba crops during week,grain oilseed,"Widespread, soaking rains aided crop development across the province, with the northwest crop producing region receiving the most precipitation, according to the Manitoba Agriculture weekly crop report. The rains replenished formerly low soil moisture reserves, with reserves in all areas now rated good, the report said. Plantings were virtually complete across the province and germination was well advanced. However, some fields still showed spotty stands. Cereal crops in the southwest were 90 pct germinated, with some fields already in the subsequent tillering stage, it said. Oilseeds in the northwest region were about 80 pct emerged in many areas, with other regions 50 to 70 pct emerged."
phelps dodge <pd> sets sights on acquisition,acq copper,"Phelps Dodge Corp chairman G. Robert Durham said the company is prepared to make another large non-copper acquisition and that a deal could be struck in the near future. In an interview with Reuters, Durham said the company was examining potential candidates but not yet talking with any. He declined to name the companies but said a deal could occur as soon as the second half of 1987. Phelps Dodge, which ranks as the largest copper producer in the U.S., last year paid 240 mln dlrs for Columbian Chemicals Co, a maker of carbon black which is used in rubber and tires among other products. The purchase was part of a strategic plan to diversify and eventually match earnings from non-copper operations and copper operations. Phelps Dodge could spend between 250 mln and 500 mln dlrs to buy another non-copper company, Durham said, citing about 100 mln dlrs of cash and 580 mln dlrs of untapped bank credit. Any acquisition candidate would have to have a different economic cycle than copper, substantial earnings and good management, he said. Phelps Dodge would only want a friendly deal, he added. ""We're not talking high-tech, or financial services or about a perfume company,"" he said. ""We want a good basic industrial company that will fit into our management structure,"" Durham said. During the interview, Durham and other executives also said continued strong demand and tight copper supply should lead to higher prices for the metal. ""In my view, it's not a matter of if but when the price (for copper) will improve because there aren't that many new projects coming on, and demand, short of a major recession, will continue to grow modestly,"" said executive vice president Douglas Yearley. Phelps Dodge continues to lower its cost of producing copper, the executives said. Costs should be below 50 cents a pound, after depreciation but before interest and corporate expense, by 1989 or 1990. Production costs are about 56 to 57 cents a pound now compared to one dlr a pound in 1981, some Wall St analysts said. Durham said copper supplies are lower than they have been for almost 20 years and demand continued to be strong. He declined to project results for the second quarter or year. But he said the quarter was going well and the rise in copper prices in the last month will help results. Durham said last month that the second quarter should match the first quarter when earnings rose about 11 pct to 16.8 mln dlrs or 49 cts a share. First quarter sales rose 61.5 pct to 372.9 mln dlrs, reflecting the acquisition of Columbian Chemicals and increased copper shipments from the Chino copper mine in New Mexico, also acquired last year. Analysts are projecting 1987 earnings of 2.20 dlrs to 2.75 dlrs a share, up sharply from 1.79 dlrs in 1986."

Amoco Canada president T. Don Stacy told an oilsands conference that ""Amoco Canada has presented the solution to the Dome problem, and we're investing our confidence, dollars and determination to make that solution work."" The Amoco buyout of debt-burdened Dome has angered Canadian nationalists, who want a Canadian buyer for Dome. Stacy described Amoco Canada's previously reported share offer proposal as a chance to increase Canadian ownership of the country's oil and gas industry, now at about 50 pct. He reiterated that Amoco planned virtually no layoffs of Dome employees. He also reaffirmed that Amoco would reinvest in Amoco Canada-Dome properties all available cash flow for five years after the acquisition."
u.s. senate team wants multinational gulf force,ship crude,"The leaders of a U.S. Senate team probing American defense strategy in the MidEast Gulf said they favored a multinational force to keep oil flowing through the waterway. Sen. John Glenn and John Warner, in Kuwait as part of a Gulf Arab tour, said at a news conference that top officials in the area appeared ready to discuss extra facilities needed if the U.S. upgraded its defense role. The Senate team next heads for the United Arab Emirates, their last stop on a fact-finding mission prompted by Reagan administration plans to let half of Kuwait's 22-tanker fleet fly the U.S. flag. Glenn and Warner said the U.S., Britain and France, should explore the possibility of a unified Gulf force. ""The American ships, the British ships, the French ships now talk to each other and all we've got to do is formalize this arrangement,"" Warner said. Glenn said a multinational force could be effectively deployed within 24 hours of a decision. Glenn voiced a preference for a United Nations multinational force, or failing that, an American, British, French force with cooperation from the Gulf Arab states. Warner voiced concern that the Soviet Union might use the situation in the Gulf to raise its presence. ""And, unequivocally, all GCC states we have talked with, have said that would not be in the interests of the Arabian peninsula."""
cominco <clt> sets tentative talks on strike,lead zinc,"Cominco Ltd said it set tentative talks with three striking union locals that rejected on Saturday a three-year contract offer at Cominco's Trail and Kimberley, British Columbia lead-zinc operations. The locals, part of United Steelworkers of America, represent 2,600 production and maintenance workers. No date has been set for the talks, the spokesman replied to a query. The spokesman said talks were still ongoing with the two other striking locals, representing 600 office and technical workers. Production at Trail and Kimberley has been shut down since the strike started May 9. Each of the five locals has a separate contract that expired April 30, but the main issues are similar. The Trail smelter produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long tons of lead last year, while the Sullivan mine at Kimberley produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore last year, most for processing at Trail. Revenues from Trail's smelter totaled 356 mln Canadian dlrs in 1986."
ec watching gulf war developments,crude ship,"The European Community (EC) should watch very carefully for any developments in the Gulf War and their consequences on the oil market, EC Energy Commissioner Nicolas Mosar said today. Speaking two weeks after a U.S. warship was attacked in the Gulf, Mosar warned, ""An escalation in the Gulf would increase tensions in the oil market."" ""But I do not want to be alarmist,"" he told a news conference after an EC energy ministers meeting in Luxembourg. He said the volume of EC oil imports from the Gulf had declined to around 31 pct of total oil imports in the first three months of 1987 against 35 pct in the same period last year. ""There are also other potential sources of supplies in the world,"" he added. The issue of Gulf oil imports was not discussed at the ministers' meeting, he added. A EC committee of national experts in the so-called oil supply group would discuss Gulf oil supplies at their bi-annual meeting on June 19, he said. But any major decisions would have to be reserved for EC foreign ministers, diplomats said. West European nations have so far shown little enthusiasm for backing a U.S. plan to give military protection to merchant ships in the Gulf which could help insure the safety of oil supplies."
alberta seeding virtually complete,grain wheat oilseed rapeseed,"Ninety-six pct of Alberta and northeastern British Columbia crops have been seeded, about a week ahead of the 10 year average, according to the Alberta wheat pool report. Hard red spring wheat accounts for most acreage with 6.0 mln estimated for this year, little changed from last year. Oats acreage of 1.95 mln is unchanged on last year and barley area of 5.9 mln is also similar to last year. Rapeseed planting of an estimated 3.24 mln is expected five pct up on 1986. The south and south central areas of Alberta lacked moisture with germination patchy at best. Growth prospects in northern areas are generally in the good to very good range. Soil moisture is better in the north central and Peace areas, the wheat pool said."

Dlrs in April from a revised 89 mln dlrs in March, and 224 mln dlrs in April 1986, in a smoothed seasonally-adjusted measurement, the Statistics Department said. The March figure was revised from 69 mln dlrs. The department said in a statement seasonally adjusted, but non-smoothed figures, showed a deficit of 99 mln dlrs against 76 mln dlrs in March and 230 mln dlrs in April 1986. Totally unadjusted figures show a deficit of 83 mln dlrs against 164 mln dlrs in March, revised from 178 mln dlrs, and compared with 262 mln in April 1986. The smoothed seasonally adjusted series shows a surplus on merchandise trade of 145 mln dlrs against 135 mln dlrs in March and 30 mln dlrs in April 1986. Seasonally adjusted but non-smoothed figures show a merchandise trade surplus of 132 mln dlrs against a 148 mln dlr surplus in March and a 14 mln dlr surplus in April 1986. Unadjusted merchandise figures show a surplus of 151 mln dlrs against a 5.0 mln dlr (revised from 10 mln dlr) deficit in March and a 31 mln dlr deficit in March 1986. The smoothed seasonally adjusted deficit on invisibles was 234 mln N.Z. Dlrs against 236 mln dlrs in March and 255 in April 1986. The seasonally adjusted but non-smoothed deficit on invisibles was 240 mln dlrs against 229 mln dlrs in March and 245 mln dlrs in April 1986. The unadjusted deficit on invisibles was 234 mln dlrs against 158 mln dlrs, revised from 168 mln dlrs, in March and 231 mln dlrs in April 1986. Seasonally adjusted export and import figures were not available. The department said these figures show a continuing improvement in the current account deficit, caused mainly by an improvement in the balance on merchandise trade which has now being in surplus since november 1985."

caobisco condemns ec oils and fats tax proposal,veg-oil cocoa sugar,"The proposed European Community (EC) levy on oils and fats has been criticised by CAOBISCO, the association of EC biscuit, chocolate and confectionery manufacturers. In a letter to the President of the Council of Ministers, M. Eyskens, the association said the tax would cost the EC biscuit, cake, chocolate and confectionery industries almost 200 mln European currency units per year. The tax also was contrary to the spirit of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and could prompt U.S. Retaliatory measures on EC exports, CAOBISCO said. In a parallel move the British Biscuit, Cake, Chocolate and Confectionery Alliance has written to U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson urging him to oppose the levy. President Charles Gillett said the tax was extending the Commission's powers by allowing it to set levels of consumer taxation, an area previously reserved for national treasuries."

baker says dollar drop would be counterproductive,dlr money-fx,"Treasury Secretary James Baker said any further decline in the dollar against other currencies would be counterproductive. Baker was asked after a speech to the Pan American Economic Leadership Conference about U.S. policy in light of President Reagan's comment last week at the Venice summit that he could see some further decline in the dollar within reason. ""All of the G-7 nations believe that any further decline in the dollar would be counterproductive,"" Baker told reporters. Following the Venice press conference by Reagan, the White House clarified Reagan's comments on the dollar by saying that the United States wants a stable dollar. The main incentive for the United States to favor a weaker dollar has been the need to reduce the massive trade deficit, but the deficit has narrowed for the past two months and appears to be responding to the 40 pct drop in the dollar against the yen and the mark during the past two years."

"no yield damage yet in u.s. corn, beans - usda",grain corn oilseed soybean,"The U.S. corn and soybean crops are in mostly good condition and have not suffered any yield deterioration from recent hot, dry weather, Agriculture Department and private weather and crop analysts said. ""I don't see any reduction in yield potential yet,"" Norton Strommen, chief meteorologist at USDA told Reuters. ""The (corn and soybean) crop is actually in mostly good condition and is progressing ahead of normal, which is good,"" he said. Abnormally hot, dry weather in midwestern crop areas sparked a sharp rally in Chicago futures today, causing new crop soybeans to advance the 30 cent daily limit to 6.14 dlrs per bushel and September corn to go up 12 cents to 2.81 dlrs. ""This rally is amazing,"" a private crop analyst said. ""Corn, soybeans and wheat are in excellent condition."" The USDA meteorologist said the only effects of the warm, dy weather on crops so far has probably been to speed up development of the crop, which will help the crop better cope with stress later in its more critical growing period. ""What this weather will do is simply push the crop towards rapid development of a good, deep root system to draw on the subsoil reserve. It actually strengthens the crop to go through a little stress early on,"" Strommen said. Strommen noted that subsoil moisture is in good shape in most growing areas. Strommen and other private crop analysts noted corn and soybeans will not enter their critical growth stages until July and August. But because of its early development this year, Strommen said the midwestern corn crop could enter its reproduction period by the first of July. ""Weatherwise, if the market is truly concerned about corn or soybeans, it should be more concerned about corn. But the dryness still has to last for another two to three weeks,"" an analyst said. Soybeans, on the other hand, can withstand several more weeks of dryness before yields start deteriorating, crop analysts agreed. August and September are the critical yield-producing months for soybeans, Strommen said. ""The sole purpose of the soybean plant is to simply survive during May, June and July until the August rains which determine the crop,"" a crop analyst said. Some analysts contend, however, that in certain growing areas the crop has not been receiving enough moisture to ensure that there will not be problems later. Strommen noted the USDA's current six to 10 day weather forecast calls for above normal temperatures and below normal precipitation in much of the corn belt. ""This opens up all sorts of speculation,"" he said."
hot weather pushes cbt grains to new highs,grain oilseed soybean corn meal-feed soy-meal,"Hot, dry weather over the Midwest, with more forecast, pushed grain futures prices to new highs today on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean futures led the advance, closing up the 30-cent-per-bushel daily trading limit in contracts for delivery after this year's fall harvest. All months set life-of-contract highs and November closed at 6.23 dlrs a bushel. ""The market is anticipating that it will stay hotter than normal for some time out,"" said David Bartholomew, assistant vice president for Merrill Lynch. ""We have probably gone as high as we need to go at this time, but I don't know how to measure the euphoria level."" Soymeal futures, which led the grain rally last week, posted contract highs and ended up the 10 dlr a ton daily limit in new-crop contracts. December closed at 195.70 dlrs. Corn futures set contract highs in March through September, with December closing up the 10 cent a bushel limit at 2.11-3/4 dlrs. Wheat posted more modest gains as dry weather improved harvest conditions in the southern Midwest. The hot weather could stress developing corn and soybean plants in the Midwest, although some periods of dryness benefit young plants by encouraging the development of deep root systems, Bartholomew said. European demand for U.S. soybeans and meal contributed to active buying here and an estimated 2.0 mln bushels of soybean orders went unfilled at the close, traders said. After trading ended, a U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) meteorologist said the U.S. corn and soybean crops have not suffered any yield loss yet from hot, dry weather. Strong grain futures ignored weakness in the value of the dollar, which can depress prices by making grains more expensive for foreign buyers. But the surge in soybeans encouraged buying at New York's COMEX, where silver futures recovered from early lows to settle steady. Managed fund traders bought silver on the belief that the weather-spurred jump in grain futures will revive fears of inflation. But the weak dollar pressured COMEX gold futures, which closed down following last Friday's news of improved U.S. trade deficit figures and better U.S. producer prices. A USDA report released after trading said the number of cattle being fed in seven major producing states was above levels expected by traders. Traders said the report would probably push live cattle futures lower tomorrow at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. USDA put cattle-on-feed in the seven major states at 7.52 mln head, 106 pct of a year ago and at the high end of trade forecasts. A total of 1.954 mln head were placed on feed during May, up 111 pct from a year ago, and May cattle marketings were off 93 pct at 1.524 mln head, USDA said. Cattle futures closed mixed in choppy trading today as hot weather slowed consumer demand for red meat, traders said."

japan ministry says dollar should be above 170 yen,dlr money-fx trade,"The dollar should worth more than 170 yen based on purchasing power parity, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) said in its annual white paper on international trade. Using 1973 as a base year, the ministry said inflation differentials pointed to a yen/dollar rate of 172 in fourth quarter 1986. The dollar opened here today at 144.90 yen. MITI also said the so-called ""J-curve"" and the drop in oil prices together accounted for 33.2 billion dlrs of the 36.6 billion dlr rise in Japan's trade surplus last year. On a customs cleared basis, the Japanese trade surplus rose to a record 82.66 billion dlrs last year. The ministry said the fall in oil prices accounted for 16.5 billion dlrs and the ""J-curve"" 17.2 billion dlrs of the rise in the 1986 surplus. Analyzing the expansion in Japan's trade imbalance in recent years, MITI calculated that 37 pct of it could be accounted for by exchange rates, 24 pct by differences in economic growth rates between Japan and other countries, and 36 pct by so-called price elasticities of imports and exports. Analyzing the expansion in the U.S. Trade deficit from 1982 to 1985, the ministry said 24 pct was accounted for by exchange rates, 34 pct by differences in the income elasticity of imports and exports and 39 pct by differences in economic growth rates. The figures do not tally to 100 pct because other minor factors have been left out. ""One index of trade structure, the income elasticity of exports and imports, shows that the U.S. Is more likely to experience increases in imports, while Japan is structurally predisposed to growth in exports,"" MITI said. Structural adjustment is already underway in Japan, under the impact of the strong yen, MITI said. Japanese companies are stepping up their imports and expanding capacity overseas. Japanese consumer attitudes are also changing. The ministry cited a survey showing that price was now the number one factor in the purchase of imports from the U.S. And Western Europe, replacing design and brand reputations. ""The smooth adjustment of the economic structure calls for measures to address the needs of affected firms,"" it said. ""Whole industries have felt the pinch and employment is expected to suffer."" ""Sustained economic growth, led by domestic demand, will also be an essential condition,"" the ministry said. It said four structural factors have contributed to the growth of the U.S. Trade deficit in recent years -- a decline in U.S. Industrial competitiveness, insufficient productive capacity, an increase in foreign procurement by U.S. Companies and short-sighted U.S. Management attitudes. ""While (U.S.) exports have picked up somewhat with the dollar's fall in value, no marked improvements have appeared in the import picture,"" MITI said."
taiwan issues more cds to curb money supply growth,money-supply reserves,"The Central Bank has issued 8.29 billion Taiwan dlrs worth of certificates of deposit (CDs), raising total CD issues so far this year to 228.27 billion, a bank official told Reuters. The CDs, with maturities of six months, one and two years, bear interest rates ranging from 4.05 to 5.25 pct, she said. The issues are intended to help curb the growth of the M-1b money supply which is expanding due to the rise in Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves, now at some 60 billion U.S. Dlrs."
"taiwan, uruguay in price dispute over soybeans",oilseed soybean,"Uruguayan suppliers have agreed to supply Taiwan with only 25,000 tonnes of soybeans out of a total 70,000 tonnes agreed in April, a spokesman for the joint committee of Taiwan's soybean importers told Reuters. He said a rise in world prices had made the Uruguayans reluctant to ship any soybeans at the agreed price of 226.56 U.S. Dlrs per tonne. The Uruguayans agreed to supply part of the shipment after the Taiwan committee threatened last week to cancel the order, but they postponed delivery to July 1-20 from the original June 5-25, the committee spokesman said. Government sources in Montevideo confirmed that Uruguayan grain exporting firms would ask Taiwan to reconsider prices on the soybeans but said the government would not intervene in the dispute. ""The deal was agreed to between two private companies, without any participation whatsoever from the Uruguayan government,"" Uruguyan Agriculture Ministry spokesman Andres Bonino said. He added, ""Uruguay is not going to export 70,000 tonnes of soybeans, since total production this year has been lower than that figure."" The contract called for the Uruguayans to deliver the 70,000 tonnes in two shipments between June 5 and August 10. Taiwan's ambassador in Montevideo, Henry Wang, told reporters, ""Both countries are finishing details to arrive at a satisfactory price."" He said the price would be ""very advantageous (for Uruguay) because it will be above the international price."" Taiwan bought some 36,000 tonnes of soybean last year, making it Uruguay's biggest customer for the oilseed. Taiwan's joint committee holds a tender today for two shipments of U.S. Soybeans totalling 87,000 tonnes."
"japan buys 50,000 tonnes of canadian rapeseed",oilseed rapeseed,"Japanese crushers have so far bought 50,000 tonnes of Canadian rapeseed for shipment in late July/August and total purchases for the period are likely to be around 130,000 tonnes, trade sources said. Crushers reduced their Canadian purchases for late June and July to 111,000 from 120,000 tonnes due to seasonal maintenance work at oil mills. But estimated crushers' buying for July/August was slightly above monthly average and is likely to keep to this level for a while due to a better crushing margin compared with that of soybeans, they said."

bundesbank may lift veto on ecu use - sources,money-fx interest,"The Bundesbank could announce today that it will lift its veto on the private holding of European Currency Unit (ECU) liabilities, banking sources said. But this would probably be the only significant news from today's council session, brought forward from its usual Thursday date because of the Corpus Christi holiday here. The Bundesbank is not expected to change credit policy. The sources said Bundesbank officials had been working out technical and legal problems with the ECU since the subject was discussed in the presence of federal finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg on May 7. With the primary internal work on the ECU completed, approval from the 18-member central bank council was now virtually a mere formality, the sources said. Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl, chairing today's meeting, said in mid-May the remaining ECU restrictions were likely to be lifted, allowing individuals to open ECU accounts and incur liabilities previously mainly executed through the Luxembourg subsidiaries of the major German banks. The sources said the ECU liberalisation was mainly designed to show that West Germany was prepared to play its part in the effort to attain European Community monetary unity by 1992."
zinc concentrate supply shortfall seen in 1988,zinc lead copper,"Next year is likely to see a shortfall in zinc concentrates of up to 100,000 tonnes, although there should be ample supply in 1987, Shearson Lehman Brothers Ltd metals analyst Stephen Briggs said. Speaking on the second day of Metal Bulletin's base metals conference, Briggs said the major factor in his predicted 100,000 tonne shortfall in zinc concentrate supply in 1988 was the imminent cessation of new mining and termination of milling at Pine Point in Canada. However, this could be partially offset by some stockpiles. Nevertheless, despite this predicted shortfall there was unlikely to be any dramatic change in treatment charges in 1988. The picture for 1987, on the other hand, was one of record production of zinc metal with fewer strikes anticipated in Canada, some improvement in South America and new capacity in South Korea. ""Dramatic new record levels of concentrate output are also expected in 1987,"" Briggs said. This would partly be due to a return to more normal levels at existing mines in Australia and Peru, allied with achievement of full capacity of 170,000 tonnes a year at Faro in Canada. Looking further forward, the major event was the probable opening in 1991 of the Red Dog mine in Alaska with a capacity of 300,000 tonnes of concentrates a year. ""Once this mine is fully on stream it is unlikely that there will be a major shortage of concentrates in the early 1990s,"" he added. The picture for lead was also closely allied to that of zinc, with no new dedicated lead mines planned and therefore supply of concentrates largely dependent on by-products from zinc mines. ""On this basis, our calculations point to a modest oversupply of lead concentrates in 1987,"" Briggs said. The copper forecast, however, was for a record non-Socialist output of 6.6 mln tonnes of concentrates in 1987, increasing by a further 150,000 tonnes in 1988. Production of primary refined copper metal would also increase, but not by as much as concentrate output, leading to a moderate oversupply of concentrates of up to 150,000 tonnes this year and with no shortages predicted for the rest of the decade, he said."
japan has no plans to liberalise farm market,grain rice,"Japan has no plans to liberalise its farm markets, but will try to narrow the gap between the price of farm products at home and overseas, Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato said. He told reporters the move is aimed at deflecting criticism of Japanese protectionism on its agricultural goods. But Kato said he has no plans to start bilateral trade talks with the United States over rice, Japan's staple food. Washington has called Tokyo's rice policy an extreme example of protectionism and has demanded access for U.S. Growers to the Japanese market. This is closed to imports except in emergency. Kato said Japanese farmers should however ""shed some blood,"" to relieve the dangerous state of international farm trade. His comments precede a meeting on July 1 and 2 of the Rice Price Council at which the government advisory body will discuss the 1987 crop producer rice price. Kato said he welcomed the outcome of last week's recent summit of leaders of leading industrialised democracies in Venice and of farm trade talks at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in May. Ministers at both conferences agreed on the long-term need to cut subsidies worldwide, Kato said. Kato said that Japan is not the only country to protect producers. He said the United States spends some 25.8 billion dlrs a year to support producer prices and on its export enhancement program and the EC 21.7 billion, while Japan spends only 2.9 billion. He said that although Japan provides the world's highest level of subsidies per acre, its subsidy per farm family was several times lower than in the United States. Expressing concern about growing protectionist moves in U.S. Congress, he said Japan should make efforts to prevent farm trade issues between the two countries from becoming a factor increasing protectionism in the United States. Japan and the United States are holding panel discussions at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade over Japan's import restrictions on 12 farm items. Bilateral talks on beef and citrus trade in the period from next April are due to start this autumn."
taiwan parliament backs free capital outflows,money-fx reserves trade,"Parliament approved a proposal to drop all controls on capital outflows, raising the prospect that Taiwan's vast resevoir of foreign exchange will flow into the world economy. A government spokesman said the new law would be promulgated by President Chiang Ching-Kuo within 10 days and financial authorities would then be empowered to lift controls on currency outflows at any time. Tight restrictions on capital inflows introduced this year will remain in place, the spokesman said. Central Bank Governor Chang Chi-Cheng has said the controls will be lifted at the end of next month or early in August. The central bank and finance ministry proposed lifting currency restrictions to help reduce Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves, which stand at about 60 billion U.S. Dlrs and have led to runaway growth in money supply. The reserves, the world's third largest after Japan and West Germany, also draw attention to Taiwan's huge trade surplus and the government fears they are making the island a target for U.S. Trade protectionism. The surplus rose 34 pct to a record 7.32 billion U.S. Dlrs in the first five months of this year and about 90 pct of it was with the United States. Money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 51.9 pct in the year to end-April, raising fears of higher inflation. Local bankers and economists say when the controls are lifted, businessmen will be allowed to buy foreign currency and invest it freely overseas. But they warn against expectations of a sudden outflow of capital. ""I don't think we're going to see a big bang,"" John Brinsden, the Taiwan manager of Standard Chartered Bank told Reuters in a recent interview. Bankers said that businessmen have been holding vast quantities of foreign exchange overseas for many years and also have been freely buying and exporting currency through a flourishing black-market. ""Obviously there will be an outflow of funds ... But I don't think it's going to be much,"" said Danny Chan, director of Fidelity Securities Investment Consulting Corp. Economists say the success of plans to encourage capital outflow depend on whether the central bank can slow the rise of the local currency. The Taiwan dollar has risen by about 23 pct against the U.S. Dollar since September 1983, prompting an inflow of speculative money. It rose by one Taiwan cent today to close at 31.08. The government spokesman said the new law does not empower authorities to permanently lift capital controls, but any proposal to reimpose them would need the approval of parliament. Many economists believe that once the controls are lifted it will be almost impossible to reimpose them."

japan 1986/87 compound feed output up 2.3 pct,meal-feed livestock carcass grain corn sorghum oilseed soy-meal rapeseed,"Japanese compound feed output rose 2.3 pct to 25.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87 ended March 31 from 25.23 mln a year earlier, the Agriculture Ministry said. The marginal rise reflected slight growth in demand for poultry raising and a moderate increase in demand for beef cattle raising, Ministry officials said. Compound feed sales totalled 26.01 mln tonnes in 1986/87 against 25.40 mln a year ago, while end-March stocks were 217,554 tonnes against 224,101. Corn use in feed output in 1986/87 rose to 11.71 mln tonnes from 11.02 mln a year earlier due to low import prices. The officials said corn imports rose because the world surplus and the yen's strength against the dollar reduced Chicago prices. The corn compounding ratio rose to 45.2 pct in 1986/87 from 43.4 pct a year earlier. Sorghum use rose marginally to 4.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87 from 4.79 mln, but the compounding ratio fell to 18.5 pct from 18.9 pct because of greater corn use. Higher import prices due to poor harvests last year in major producing nations such as Argentina made feed makers reluctant to use sorghum. Soybean meal use fell to 2.58 mln tonnes from 2.63 mln and the compounding ratio declined to 10.0 pct from 10.3 pct. The drop in soybean meal consumption resulted from increased use of cheaper rapeseed meal, the officials said. Rapeseed consumption in 1986/87 was 563,889 tonnes against 528,152 a year earlier. The compounding ratio rose to 2.2 pct from 2.1 pct."

The committee rejected a tender today for a cargo of 27,000 to 33,000 tonnes on the grounds the prices offered by the U.S. Suppliers were too high, he said. The committee will be seeking a further shipment of between 27,000 and 33,000 tonnes when it reopens the tender tomorrow, he added."
vessel lost in pacific was carrying lead,ship lead,"The 37,635 deadweight tonnes bulk carrier Cumberlande, which sank in the South Pacific last Friday, was carrying a cargo which included lead as well as magnesium ore, a Lloyds Shipping Intelligence spokesman said. He was unable to confirm the tonnages involved. Trade reports circulating the London Metal Exchange said the vessel, en route to New Orleans from Newcastle, New South Wales, had been carrying 10,000 tonnes of lead concentrates. Traders said this pushed lead prices higher in early morning trading as the market is currently sensitive to any fundamental news due to its finely balanced supply/demand position and low stocks. Trade sources said that 10,000 tonnes of lead concentrates could convert to around 5,000 tonnes of metal, although this depended on the quality of the concentrates. A loss of this size could cause a gap in the supply pipeline, particularly in North America, they noted. Supplies there have been very tight this year and there is a strike at one major producer, Cominco, and labour talks currently being held at another, Noranda subsidiary Brunswick Mining and Smelting Ltd."
indonesia rejects world bank farm reform proposals,grain rice sugar,"Indonesia rejected World Bank recommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy, as the country's foreign aid donors met to consider giving it 2.5 billion dlrs in grants and soft loans. Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarks distributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations met at The Hague, said, ""The general argument presented by the Bank for this free trade, open economy view is weak."" The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages the largest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agricultural growth was stagnating under subsisides for rice farming. The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peaked and the subsidies are a waste of money. Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and provides an income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies were needed to support the fertilizer industry, including importers, exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well as assisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers. Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmers should be free to choose their own crops, but he said the government would continue to maintain production targets for ""strategic commodities"" such as rice and sugar. The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia's drive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are double the world average because of inefficiencies, and the country would save money by importing the commodity. However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the need to save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugar industry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive. He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in the agricultural sector were needed to help domestic industry develop and because of ""over-production and price intervention in the developed nations."""
budget pact cuts u.s. farm funds 1.25 billion dlrs,grain corn,"U.S. House and Senate budget negotiators agreed as part of an overall budget accord reached yesterday, to cut 1.25 billion dlrs from fiscal 1988 spending on agricultural programs, Congressional sources told Reuters. The agreed cut in farm programs is a compromise between 1.4 billion sought by the Senate and one billion by the House. The negotiators also agreed to cut 1.6 billion from the farm budget in fiscal 1989 and 2.45 billion in 1990, for a total of 5.3 billion in saving over three years, sources said. The agreement presents the House and Senate Agriculture committees with difficult choices on how to make changes in agriculture programs that achieve the budget savings targets without jeopardizing popular support payments, senior Congressional aides told Reuters. Some farm state lawmakers already are manuevering to find the budget savings. Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., Chairman of the House grains subcommittee, has introduced a bill which would freeze wheat and corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 2.28 dlrs and 1.92 dlrs respectively, saying it would save 500 mln dlrs. House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza has said the committee will consider the Glickman proposal. But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely to be approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers and a strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who said freezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other major grain export competitors and would not achieve the budget savings Glickman claims. Another area where Glickman and other have said budget savings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program, ARP, levels for wheat and corn. However, on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong stand within the Reagan administration, arguing that the 1988 crop wheat acreage reduction should be left at 27.5 pct and not 30 pct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB. Most commodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail. Congressional sources said the only way to achieve significant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boost the 1988 corn ARP. But one informed Congressional source said singling-out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen as unfair to one commodity. Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is most likely to eventually look for budget savings are some tightening of the payment limitation rules, and possible adoption of a 0/92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains. Those changes would achieve a portion of the 1.25 billion but not enough, they said. Ultimately, Congressional sources said the agriculture committees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut on all Commodity Credit Corp. payments to farmers, including price support loans and deficiency payments, similar to the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986. This idea has been suggested by the American Farm Bureau Federation, AFBF, as the fairest approach for all commodities."
new zealand budget forecast seen as positive,money-fx nzdlr,"Analysts said they were surprised at the government's announcement of a forecast budget surplus for fiscal 1988 but said it was consistent with previous policy statements and positive for the economy. Finance Minister Roger Douglas predicted a budget surplus for the year ending March 1988 of 379 mln New Zealand dlrs against a 1.95 billion deficit last year. Analysts polled by Reuters said the forecast budget surplus was even more positive than the most bullish analysts' forecasts and that this was good news for financial markets. Market expectations among analysts questioned by Reuters before the budget varied widely between a balanced budget and a 2.3 billion dlr deficit. But none predicted a surplus. The forecast initially looks positive for both the bond and the foreign exchange markets, one analyst said. Paradoxically, the New Zealand dollar could rise in the medium term, despite lower interest rates, as overseas investors became more confident about investing in New Zealand, he said. However, some foreign exchange dealers disagreed, saying the local dollar is primarily interest rate driven and will move lower. The local dollar dropped to 0.5940/50 U.S. Dlrs in after hours trading, against 0.5970/77 just before the budget release. Analysts said the budget was also positive for the share market, despite an increase in the contribution of company taxation to revenue figures. One equities analyst predicted that the budget surplus announcement could push the share market up by 50 points tomorrow. The Budget statement was broadly as expected, with a continuation of existing policies, and the absence of traditional pre-election incentives would be viewed positively by overseas investors, another said. But one merchant bank economist said that certain anti-tax avoidance measures could damage some sectors of the share market, particularly multi-national companies. The government is also lowering its borrowing requirements, through bond tenders, as a result of the surplus. The requirement for the rest of the year is now down to 950 mln N.Z. Dlrs from a predicted 1.75 billion. Predicted revenue in the Budget looked sustainable and there appeared to be no holding back on expenditure, another economist said. He added that the document seemed entirely credible. ""Altogether it looks good for Labour's election prospects,"" he said. An election is due before the end of September."

westcoast <wtc> to acquire agip properties,crude nat-gas,"Westcoast Transmission Co Ltd said it agreed to acquire the Western Canada oil and gas reserves and properties of AGIP Canada Ltd, a subsidiary of AGIP SpA, part of Italy's ENI group, for 54 mln Canadian dlrs. At the end of 1986, AGIP Canada reported proven and probable reserves of 4.2 mln barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 22.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas. AGIP Canada also holds 176,000 net exploratory acres in Western Canada. Its properties produce about 1,100 barrels of oil a day. The deal is subject to approval by both companies' directors. Westcoast said the acquisition would enable it to apply more than 150 mln dlrs of accumulated tax pools of AGIP Canada Ltd to enhance after-tax cash flow from the acquired properties. AGIP Canada said it would retain offshore exploration blocks in Labrador, a gold mine in Yukon Territory and uranium interests in Saskatchewan."
u.k. data depress rate cut outlook - analysts,interest reserves jobs income,"Today's U.K. Economic data have pushed the chances of another base lending rate cut from the current nine pct further into the distance, analysts said. A record fall in unemployment and good manufacturing production data showed that the economy is still strong and does not need a fillip from lower rates. News that underlying earnings are rising 7.75 pct annually, taken together with higher than expected bank lending and money supply growth, revived inflation worries and monetarist arguments against easier credit, they said. ""The timetable on lower interest rates is being pushed back all the while. The strength of the economy and broad money growth are making it more difficult to see one in the near term,"" said Chase Manhattan Securities economist Robin Marshall. Analysts have reached this conclusion despite yesterday's mortgage rate cuts for new borrowers, which building societies said were a sign of the expected near term trend for U.K. Rates. It also counters the optimistic forecasts of last week that a post-general election cut was imminent, supported by such optimistic economic news as May's record reserves rise which mirrored the Bank of England efforts to cap sterling's strength. The gilt market lost nearly half a point as enthusiasm about May's 64,300 fall in the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate, to 2.95 mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, was rapidly replaced by dismay at the continued high level of underlying average earnings in April, dealers said. The upset was compounded by news that sterling bank lending rose 2.7 billion stg in May, above forecast, and that the Bank of England looks likely to have to sell more gilts to offset the impact on domestic money supply of its current intervention. ""The gilt market reaction was correct,"" said Bill Martin, chief U.K. Economist at brokers Phillips and Drew. ""That's very important ... It shows the economy in a very good state indeed,"" Skeoch said. ""There's no reason to get worries about inflationary pressures because they're very subdued."" Unit wage cost rises were better than expected, just one pct higher in the year to April, and it was these costs rather than average earnings which were potentially inflationary, he added. ""I don't think these average earnings numbers are a major problem,"" agreed Chase Manhattan's Marshall. But he said the gilts market was likely to remain worried about the funding implications of recent intervention. He said the inflow of foreign money into sterling assets earlier this year, attracted by growth prospects and hopes that the ruling Conservatives would win last week's election, now looks likely to prevent a base rate cut as the authorities try to prevent these funds swelling the domestic money system. However, David Owen, U.K. Economist at Kleinwort Grieveson Securities, said any fresh sterling strength would still trigger a base rate cut and that today's figures did not signal higher inflation this year. ""Wage increases are being offset by productivity growth. As long as that continues we're okay,"" he added."

"growth of palm oil use set to slow, output to rise",veg-oil palm-oil soy-oil rape-oil cotton-oil coconut-oil sun-oil,"The rate of increase in world palm oil use is likely to slow next season despite an expected 800,000 tonne production rise to 8.13 mln tonnes, Siegfried Mielke, editor of the Hamburg-based newsletter Oil World said. He told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days that in the next Oct/Sept 1987/88 season, palm oil use will rise to 8.25 mln tonnes from 7.71 mln, below the five-year average increase of 550,000 tonnes. Opening stocks at the start of next October are expected to be about 1.4 mln tonnes, 300,000 tonnes below year-earlier levels, bringing total supplies to 9.5 mln tonnes, he said. The anticipated total supplies will be about 500,000 tonnes above this season's available amount, Mielke said. The increase in mature palm tree areas in Malaysia will slow down from this year on, but that will be offset by area expansion in Indonesia, he said. He estimated the combined rise in Malaysian and Indonesian mature area at 8.7 pct next year, after 9.5 pct this year, and at 6.7 pct in 1989 and 5.0 pct in 1990. Malaysia also is shifting plantings to Sabah and Sarawak, where the rate of expansion is higher than in the Peninsula, but where yields are lower, he said. The stocks/usage ratio of seven major oils is also expected to decline, Mielke said. The oils are soybean, cottonseed, sunflowerseed, coconut, rapeseed, palmkernel and palm. At the start of October 1986 stocks of these oils were unusually high and represented 6.8 weeks of the current season's prospective demand, compared with six weeks a year ago and with 5.4 weeks in 1984, he said. Mielke expects the ratio to fall to 5.9 weeks by the start of next October and to the unusually low level of 5.4 weeks by the end of next season. The stocks/usage ratio for palm oil was 11.4 weeks last October and is likely to be 8.7 weeks next October and 7.7 at the end of next season, Mielke said. World oilseed stocks also are expected to fall in the course of the next season, with the biggest reduction seen in soybean stocks, which Mielke expects to decline by 5.0 mln tonnes or by one fifth. Almost all of the decline is expected to occur in the U.S., for which he estimated ending stocks next season at 10.7 mln tonnes, or 393 mln bushels, against anticipated ending stocks of 15 mln tonnes, or 551 mln bushels, at the end of this season."
ecuador has trade surplus in first four months,trade reserves,"Ecuador posted a trade surplus of 10.6 mln dlrs in the first four months of 1987 compared with a surplus of 271.7 mln in the same period in 1986, the central bank of Ecuador said in its latest monthly report. Ecuador suspended sales of crude oil, its principal export product, in March after an earthquake destroyed part of its oil-producing infrastructure. Exports in the first four months of 1987 were around 639 mln dlrs and imports 628.3 mln, compared with 771 mln and 500 mln respectively in the same period last year. Exports of crude and products in the first four months were around 256.1 mln dlrs, compared with 403.3 mln in the same period in 1986. The central bank said that between January and May Ecuador sold 16.1 mln barrels of crude and 2.3 mln barrels of products, compared with 32 mln and 2.7 mln respectively in the same period last year. Ecuador's international reserves at the end of May were around 120.9 mln dlrs, compared with 118.6 mln at the end of April and 141.3 mln at the end of May 1986, the central bank said. gold reserves were 165.7 mln dlrs at the end of May compared with 124.3 mln at the end of April."

The sources said there had been no bids for licences for free market soft wheat and non-Spanish barley exports to non-EC countries."
bank of america sees slow u.s. consumer spending,gnp income housing,"A trade-led boom in the U.S. is unlikely this year or next because growth in net exports will merely offset a dramatic slowdown in consumer spending and other sectors of the economy, Bank of America said in its latest economic report. Although net exports will add 0.7 pct to GNP this year, after reducing it by 1.2 pct in 1986, consumer spending will contribute 1.4 pct less to GNP than it did last year. As a result, GNP this year is likely to expand a modest 2.5 pct, the same rate as last year, according to Daniel Van Dyke, the Bank of America economist who wrote the report. ""Growth in consumer spending in the United States will drop dramatically this year because the jump in inflation will cause a falloff in the growth of disposable income,"" Van Dyke said. Growth in U.S. consumer spending is likely to slow to 1.8 pct this year from 4.1 pct in 1986, he predicted. The report was released before the Commerce Department reported today that personal income rose just 0.2 pct in May, after increasing 0.4 pct in April, and that personal consumption expenditures had risen just 0.1 pct, compared with a 0.6 pct increase the month before. The rising cost of energy and imports is likely to boost consumer prices by an average of 3.7 pct this year, up from 1.9 pct in 1986, Bank of America forecast. This rise in inflation will reduce real disposable income growth to only 1.3 pct in 1987 from 2.9 pct in 1986. As a result, Van Dyke calculated that the purchasing power of an average family of four will increase by a modest 540 dlrs this year compared to a surge of 1,210 dlrs during 1986. The slowdown in income growth is likely to cause housing starts to drop by 4.2 pct this year and a further six pct in 1988 to an annual rate of 1.63 mln units. ""For the first time in several years, a recession in 1988 or 1989 is more than a remote possibility,"" Van Dyke said. Currently, U.S. growth is fragile and depends heavily on an improvement in trade. ""However, with protectionist attitudes on the rise in this country, this source of growth is at risk,"" he added."
china adds corn to commitments - usda,grain corn,"China has added 30,000 tonnes of U.S. corn to its previous commitments, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department's latest Export Sales report.

Total corn commitments for delivery in the 1986/87 season amount to 1,083,400 tonnes."
senator defends u.s. mandatory farm control bill,grain corn,"Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, defended his controversial mandatory supply control farm bill and said U.S. farmers should be allowed to vote in a referendum whether they approve of the proposal. The Harkin proposal would set loan rates of 5.17 dlrs per bushel for wheat, 3.77 dlrs for corn and 9.32 dlrs for soybeans, all to be put in effect under strict controls on planted acreage reductions. Present loan rates are 2.28 dlrs for wheat, 1.92 for corn, and effectively 4.56 for soybeans. Also under the plan, the U.S. would seek a world market sharing cartel with the European Community and other exporting nations, to share-out export markets, Harkin said during the first of several Senate Agriculture subcommittee hearings examining farm programs. Harkin made the following claims in testimony on his ""Family Farm Act."" -- The mandatory control bill would increase farm income and reduce government spending on agriculture. -- Harkin said his policy of high price supports would not ruin U.S. agricultural exports as critics claim, but would increase overall revenue from exports. This would be done by seeking agreement among major exporting countries including the European Community on market sharing at agreed high prices. Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., countered during the hearing that such a grain export cartel is not workable. -- Harkin acknowledged that higher commodity price supports would be passed onto consumers, but he said high food prices stem more from ""gouging"" by food processing companies than from high farm product prices. Harkin cited what he termed ""excessive"" net returns on equity over five years of 33.4 pct at Kellogg, 31.9 pct Monfort, 22.8 pct Nabisco, 22.8 pct ConAgra, 21.2 pct H.J. Heinz, 19.1 pct Ralston Purina, 17.2 pct Pillsbury and 16.7 pct Quaker Oats. -- Harkin said a ""legitimate"" concern about his bill would be the impact of higher prices on livestock producers. He said as a transition to the higher prices, he would allow livestock producers to purchase Commodity Credit Corp. grain stocks for three years. Thereafter, livestock farmers would benefit from a ""predictable and stable"" grain price, he said. -- Harkin said that under his policy approach farm participation would be no more ""mandatory"" than the current farm program. He said farmers now must participate in farm programs in order to receive credit for planting and to protect farm income."
oecd sees german growth hit by low domestic demand,gnp bop,"West German economic growth will slow to 1.5 pct this year from 2.4 pct in 1986 due to weak domestic demand and tougher competition from abroad, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said in its semi-annual review of the world economy. This view is less favourable than the West German government's forecast of a growth rate of under two pct this year, but is in line with forecasts by independent economic institutes of growth ranging from 1.5 to two pct. The OECD said that the economy should pick up next year, with the gross national product rising by two pct in real terms. The OECD said it assumed the German economy was passing through a period of temporary weakness and there would be some recovery in business confidence in the near future. But it warned that the key to an improvement in the economy was higher domestic demand, which is only forecast to rise by 2.5 pct this year and 2.75 pct in 1988, below 1986's 3.7 pct. While noting that the government is bringing forward a five billion mark tax reform to January 1988, the OECD said that ""the medium to longer-term performance of the West German economy could be improved by reduction of subsidies - which would allow relatively lower tax rates."" Since the OECD report was compiled, the West German Federal Statistics Office has released figures showing that the GNP actually fell 0.5 pct in real terms in the first quarter of this year compared with the final three months of 1986. Diplomatic sources here said that West Germany appeared likely to finish the year with the lowest growth rate of any of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations. West Germany's current account surplus, the target of considerable criticism by the Reagan administration, is expected to rise slightly to 37 billion dlrs this year from 35.8 billion in 1986, before declining to 29 billion dlrs in 1988."
"higher growth, unemployment in france, oecd says",gnp jobs cpi,"France's growth rate is expected to strengthen in the second half of this year after a poor first half, but unemployment will worsen, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said. In its semi-annual review of the world economy, the OECD forecast that growth in the French Gross Domestic Product (GDP) would run at about two pct in the next six months. It said the rate would be in line with the 1986 trends, but significantly higher than in the first half of this year. The OECD said France's economic situation has deteriorated somewhat during the early months of 1987. Activity has slowed, primarily reflecting an inventory adjustment, while unemployment has risen rapidly and inflation has reaccelerated, the OECD said. Unemployment is likely to reach 12 pct of the workforce by the end of 1988. The report said inflation should slow and domestic demand pick up in the second half of this year. But both data are likely to be worse than those recorded in 1986, it added. The OECD forecast a 2.75 pct rise in consumer prices for the second half of this year, a one pct drop from the first six months. The slowdown would bring the inflation rate to 3.25 pct for the whole year, sharply up from last year's 2.2 pct."
"italian economic outlook less bright, oecd says",gnp jobs,"Italy's economic outlook for 1987 and 1988 is likely to be less favourable than last year with slightly lower growth, higher unemployment and an increased trade deficit, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said. But the OECD, in its half-yearly report, forecast a slightly lower inflation rate over the next two years. Last year Italy ranked as one of the OECD's fastest growing economies with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth at 2.7 pct. The OECD said Italy's GDP may grow by three pct in 1987, but will then fall back to 2.5 pct in 1988. The inflation rate will probably stabilise at around five pct during the projection period as a result of a turnaround in import prices, particularly oil, an acceleration in labour costs and the effects of domestic demand pressure, the report said. This year, and to a lesser degree in 1988, domestic demand should be stimulated by buoyant growth in household consumption made possible by wage increases following pay negotiations. Domestic demand pressure, coupled with the deterioration in Italian competitiveness, is likely to stimulate imports and adversely affect exports in 1987 and 1988. This could result in a sharp negative contribution to the currrent account."
"japan trade surplus will grow again in 1987, oecd",trade bop gnp,"Japan's trade surplus is likely to continue to grow in 1987, as sales of Japanese goods abroad increase while domestic demand remains sluggish, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said. In its latest half-yearly review of the world economy, the OECD said Japan managed to considerably reduce its surplus last year, when domestic demand grew by four pct in 1986 while export markets rose by only two pct. But it said this differential between the growth of domestic and foreign demand would reverse in 1987 and 1988, ""thus weakening the international adjustment process."" It forecast a slowing in domestic growth to little over two pct but with a rise in exports of 3.3 pct in 1987 and 3.6 pct in 1988. As a result, the current account surplus in 1987 will rise to 95 billion dlrs from 86 billion in 1986, although in 1988 it should fall back to 87 billion dlrs. The OECD outlook did not take account of the 6,000 billion yen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demand and increase imports to Japan. However, OECD officials said the measures will significantly strengthen domestic demand, quite possibly exceeding one pct GNP when the full effects have worked through, and thus will provide some stimulus to imports. The OECD outlook said, ""Continued large current account surpluses and the further build-up of an already-substantial net external asset position could well lead to upward pressure on the yen."" It said that further appreciation could then lead manufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thus weaken domestic growth. The OECD said Japan's Gross National Product was likely to gorw an annual two pct in 1987 and 1988, below 1986's 2.5 pct growth. But it said Japan would continue its good performance on inflation, with a zero figure expected in 1987 compared to a 0.6 pct rise in consumer prices last year."
economic growth seen sluggish in benelux countries,gnp jobs cpi,"Economic growth will remain sluggish in the Netherlands and Belgium next year and unemployment may rise, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast. Belgium's GDP growth may slow down to 1.5 pct this year and next year, bringing a rise in the number of jobless, the OECD said in its semi-annual survey. Belgian inflation could stabilise at 1.5 to 2.0 pct, while the current account surplus will probably remain large at about three pct of GDP. While the Belgian government has made progress in trimming its borrowing requirement, ""it will probably be insufficient to check the self-sustaining nature of the deficit,"" the OECD said. In the Netherlands real GDP growth will also slip to 1.5 pct this year and one pct in 1988, with Dutch exports becoming less competitive and imports rising. ""Employment is forecast to decelerate as well, reflecting more sluggish growth in the private sector and budgetary cuts,"" the report said. Dutch consumer prices are set to fall by 0.5 pct in 1987 and stay stable in 1988, partly as a result of declining domestic gas prices. Luxembourg's economy, by contrast, will see slightly faster growth in GDP this year as a result of an upward movement in wages. But real growth in consumption will ease next year."
oecd urges action to cut u.s. budget deficit,gnp jobs bop,"The United States should take urgent action to cut its crippling budget deficit, including possible reductions in non-defense spending, higher taxes and curbs on growth of the defense budget, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said. The OECD, in its semi-annual review of the world economy, said a failure of the Reagan Administration and Congress quickly to agree on measures to cut the deficit ""could seriously affect confidence, both in the United States and elsewhere."" It predicted that the federal deficit in fiscal 1987, running until September 30 this year, would substantially overshoot both the Balanced Budget Act's target of 144 billion dlrs and official U.S. Estimates in February of 175 billion. ""The OECD projection, which is based on assumptions of slower growth, higher interest rates and actual data for the first half of the financial year, is for a deficit of about 190 billion dollars,"" it said. While this would be 30 billion lower than last year's deficit, much of the improvement would be due to corporate tax increases being introduced before income tax cuts take effect. The U.S. Economic growth rate is expected to edge up to 2.75 pct next year from 2.5 pct this year and last. In contrast to the last two years, more competitive exports boosted by the fall in the dollar should help GNP growth. Unemployment should continue to fall slowly as the service sector continues to create jobs. But inflation appears to be heading higher, partly due to the lower dollar, with consumer prices forecast to rise four pct this year and 4.5 pct next year after just 2.1 pct in 1986. ""Monetary and fiscal policy appear to be the key factors behind the avoidance of recession,"" the report said. The current account balance of payments deficit is expected to be still around a high 125 billion dlrs next year, after hitting a projected record 147.25 billion this year, it said. In Canada economic growth is expected to pick up slightly to around 2.75 pct in 1988 from 2.5 pct this year, but will still be below levels seen in recent years. Inflation is expected to slow to 3.5 pct next year from 3.75 pct this year, unemployment should edge down to nine pct in 1988 from 9.25 pct this year. Canada's current account deficit is projected to shrink to around four billion U.S. Dlrs this year and to remain at about that level in 1988."
joint action said vital to boost world growth,gnp jobs cpi,"Prospects for world economic growth remain very sluggish, and coordinated action by western governments is urgently needed to restore business confidence, stabilize currencies and encourage investment, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said here. ""The economic situation has deteriorated in recent months, and ... Slow growth, high unemployment and large payments imbalances are likely to persist,"" it said in one of its gloomiest reviews of the world economy in recent years. The gross national product (GNP) of the 24-nation bloc of western industrialised countries is forecast to grow by only 2.25 pct both this year and next, even slower than last year's 2.5 pct growth rate. ""We would like to see the aggregate for the OECD area comfortably exceeding three pct,"" David Henderson, head of the OECD's economics and statistics department, said. The OECD said that the dollar fall had led to rising inflation expectations and higher interest rates in the U.S., Combining with world trade imbalances and the huge third world debt problem to increase the risks of a world economic downturn. ""At the same time, many of the conditions for faster growth remain favorable,"" it said, citing low inflation in most major countries, healthy corporate finances, generally lower interest rates, improvements in state budget positions and more flexible labor markets. But private sector confidence had been undermined by uncertainties over exchange rates, it said, and warned that ""for confidence to be restored, it is important for governments swiftly to implement internationally-agreed commitments."" This was a clear reference to last February's Louvre accord of the Group of Five nations plus Canada, analysts said. The OECD said that apparent disagreements among major countries on implementation of the Louvre accord had helped to undermine business confidence, and called on more active fiscal policies from the U.S., West Germany and Japan to slow demand in the U.S. And raise it in the other two countries. Henderson said the 6,000 billion yen package announced recently by the Japanese government to encourage public works and cut taxes would make a significant contribution to this process, though it was too early to estimate its precise impact. He said the measures will help strengthen Japan's domestic demand significantly, quite possibly exceeding one pct of GNP. The inflation outlook, while broadly satisfactory, has worsened in recent months, with OECD consumer prices forecast to rise 3.5 pct this year and 3.75 pct in 1988 after a 2.8 pct increase in 1986. There is no prospect for any significant improvement in the unemployment situation over the next 18 months, with the average rate expected to stabilize at 8.25 pct, similar to last year. The OECD called for efforts to liberalize world agricultural markets through switching farm subsidies away from price guarantees and other measures linked to production towards direct income support for farmers."
"australia set to grow, but unemployment may rise",gnp cpi bop,"Australia's economy should manage modest growth over the next two years after a sharp slowdown but unemployment could still edge upwards, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said. The organisation's latest half-yearly report says Gross Domestic Product will grow by 2.5 pct this year and by 2.75 pct in 1988 compared with only 1.4 pct in 1986. The growth will be helped by higher stockbuilding and stronger domestic demand following tax cuts and higher real wages, it added. The report forecasts a decline in inflation, with consumer prices increasing by 8.5 pct this year and 6.25 pct in 1988. The current account deficit shows signs of easing slightly and could narrow to 12 billion dlrs by the end of 1988. While predicting slightly stronger growth than last year, however, the report revises downwards the OECD's earlier growth forecast for 1987 of 3.75 pct. The OECD predicts a similar combination of modest economic growth and rising unemployment for New Zealand, which is struggling to recover from a major economic crisis. The country's GDP, which contracted by 0.6 pct last year, should again show growth over the next two years, rising by 0.25 pct this year and a more substantial 2.75 pct in 1988."
japan still wants speculative dlr deals limited,money-fx dlr,"The Finance Ministry is still asking financial institutions to limit speculative dollar dealings, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told reporters. He was responding to rumours in the New York currency market overnight that the Ministry was reducing its pressure on institutions to refrain from excessively speculative dollar dealings."
fed data suggest no change in monetary policy,money-supply money-fx dlr,"New U.S. Banking data suggest the Federal Reserve is guiding monetary policy along a steady path and is not signalling any imminent change of course, economists said. But they also said that if money supply growth remains weak, as this week's unexpected eight billion dlr M-1 decline suggests it may, this could influence the Fed to loosen its credit reins and move toward a more accommodative monetary policy. A Reuter survey of 17 money market economists produced a forecast of a 600 mln dlr M-1 decline for the week ended June 8, with estimates ranging from a gain of one billion dlrs to a decline of four billion. Instead, M-1 fell eight billion dlrs to 745.7 billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate. Coming on the heels of a 4.3 billion decrease in M-1 for the week ended June 1, this means the nation's money supply has fallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks, economists said. ""M-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness,"" said Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. While M-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator of economic growth, Sullivan said Fed officials might be concerned the latest drop in M-1 means another month of sluggish growth in the broader monetary aggregates, M-2 and M-3, which are seen as better gauges of economic growth. Latest monthly M-2 and M-3 data showed that as of May, both measures were growing at rates below the bottom of the Fed's 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct target ranges. If money growth does not accelerate, Fed officials, concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging, could turn toward easier monetary policy, economists said. ""Does this mean that the Fed abandons its current open market position? No,"" Sullivan said. ""But does this mean the end of tightening for the time being? Definitely yes."" Economists said average adjusted discount window borrowings of 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement period were lower than they had expected. Most believed the Fed had targetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs. But they said that if it had not been for a large one-day net miss in the Fed's reserve projections, the higher borrowings target would probably have been reached. A drop in May U.S. Housing starts and continued weakness in auto sales show key sectors of the U.S. Economy are lagging, while a recent modest 0.3 pct gain in May producer prices has helped dispel inflation fears, Slifer said. ""If this continues, we can entertain the notion of Fed easing at some point,"" he said. Other economists said the Fed would probably pay little attention to weak money supply growth. ""It has been a number of years since M-1 has given good signs of what's going on in the economy,"" one said. ""I don't think M-1 shows that the economy is falling apart and the Fed should ease."" Economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be a prerequisite for any move by the Fed toward easier monetary policy. They said the Fed is reluctant to lower short-term rates for fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar and higher inflation which would push up long-term yields and choke off econmomic growth. But Sullivan said the dollar has been steady since late April. ""The Fed has to determine if this represents a fundamental change for the dollar. If it does, then this gives them more room to ease,"" he said."
taiwan dollar and reserves seen rising more slowly,money-fx reserves,"Recent government moves to curb capital inflow have temporarily helped to slow the rise of Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves and to stabilise the local dollar against the U.S. Currency, officials and bankers said. Central bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters the reserves rose only about 500 mln U.S. Dlrs in the past two weeks and the local dollar appreciated more slowly against the U.S. Dollar. Chang said, ""The pace of increase in our reserves is much slower now than before and our currency is getting more stable."" He said the reserves, mainly the result of the trade surplus with the U.S., Rose at the rate of two to three billion U.S. Dlrs a month between January and May. The reserves, the world's third largest after Japan and West Germany, now total well over 60 billion U.S. Dlrs. On June 2 the central bank froze overseas borrowings of local and foreign banks and cut the limit on central bank purchases of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40 pct from 90 pct of the value of a contract. Local and foreign bankers said the June 2 measures had drastically limited their ability to lend foreign exchange to importers and exporters. They said their overseas borrowings and forward dollar transactions showed a drastic decline with some banks registering a fall of up to 30 pct. Bank dealers said the Taiwan dollar has stabilised against the U.S. Currency this week after rising two to five Taiwanese cents a day between June 2 and 13 compared with a rise of five to eight cents in May. The bank dealers said the central bank, which had previously bought U.S. Dollars heavily, sold at least 1.1 billion U.S. Dlrs in the past two weeks to meet commercial demand. They said they expected the government to keep the local dollar stable in the near term to give breathing space to businesses experiencing slower exports because of the rise of more than 23 pct in the value of the Taiwan dollar since September 1985. The Taiwan dollar opened at 31.09 to the U.S. Dollar today, unchanged from yesterday. Keh Fei-Lo, vice president of First Commercial Bank, said, ""It appears the central bank's move to curb the capital inflow is quite successful."" Vice economic minister Wang Chien-Shien said the slower rise in foreign exchange reserves would help ease pressure from Washington over the large U.S. Trade deficit with Taiwan. Over the past year Taiwanese businessmen have delayed imports of machinery and production equipment because of exchange rate uncertainty, he said. The stable exchange rate would help boost imports, particularly from the United States."

The navy was unloading 74,000 tonnes of foodgrains from two ships today, and four vessels laden with some 90,000 tonnes of grains were waiting at the outer anchorage, port officials said. A spokesman for the workers said they would continue their strike until authorities agree to their demands for higher pay and other benefits. The strike began on June 11. ""Unloading of grains and other essential commodities started normally after we called in navy personnel to help,"" a port official told Reuters. ""The strike has caused no serious dislocation,"" he said. The government meanwhile declared the port jobs an ""essential service"" and said the strikers could be dismissed unless they end the strike soon."

agency head says japan should cut rice price,grain rice,"The government should cut its consumer rice price if the official producer price is reduced next month, Tetsuo Kondo, director general of the government's Economic Planning Agency (EPA), told reporters. Kondo said after a cabinet meeting that consumers should receive the benefits of the falling costs of rice farming due to the strong yen and lower oil prices.

The consumer rice price is usually set in December."
japan panel urges world economic adjustments,money-fx dlr yen bop gnp,"Japan could avoid a sharp rise in the value of the yen against the dollar if Japan, the U.S. And other nations succeeded in restructuring their economies, an advisory panel to the government's Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said. The advisory body said in its report that the yen would soar against the dollar if structural adjustments on a global basis were delayed. An EPA official told Reuters the dollar could fall to slightly below 100 yen by 1993 if Japan and the U.S. Failed to restructure their economies. The dollar's fall without structural adjustments would cut Japan's current account surplus to two pct of gross national product (GNP) in 1993, the report said. It said such a change would slow real GNP growth to an average of two pct annually during the seven-year period to 1993. If the two nations restructured their economies, the dollar would remain stable in real terms, while reducing Japan's current-account surplus to 2.1 pct of GNP in 1993. This scenario put Japan's GNP growth at 3.5 pct a year. It forecast real growth of three pct for the world economy and four pct for Japan by 2,000 if the adjustments were made."
s. african reserve bank says growth rate on target,gnp bop,"South Africa recorded annualised real growth in GDP of 3.25 pct in the first quarter of this year and the economy should achieve the government's target of three pct growth for 1987, the Reserve Bank said. The South African central bank said in its quarterly bulletin that confidence in the economy improved from January to May 31 because of the higher gold price, a rise in the nation's gold and foreign currency reserves and an improvement in the rand's exchange rate to just under 50 U.S. Cents. It noted the growth rate had slowed from 4.5 pct in the third and fourth quarters of last year. It also cited a three year debt recheduling agreement reached with international creditors in March as evidence of improved foreign perceptions of the South African economy. The accord effectively extends a moratorium on most repayments of 13 billion dlrs of South Africa's short term foreign debt. Total foreign debt is 23 billion dlrs. South Africa recorded a seasonally adjusted annualised surplus on the current account of the balance of payments of 7.43 billion rand in the first quarter, compared with a surplus of 7.24 billion rand in 1986. The bank said it was the ninth consecutive current account surplus since the start of 1985."

saudi oil reserves rise despite higher output,crude nat-gas,"Proven oil and gas deposits in Saudi Arabia increased in 1986 despite higher oil output, according to the kingdom's main producing company, Aramco. Recoverable oil reserves in Aramco fields rose to 167 billion barrels by the end the year from 166.5 billion in 1985, while gas reserves jumped by 7.7 pct to 135.8 trillion cu ft from 126.1 trillion, the company's annual report said. Aramco, responsible for all Saudi production except about 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, increased production to 4.69 mln barrels per day in 1986 from 3.04 mln barrels a year earlier. Most of 1986 was a virtual free-for-all in production, as OPEC members abandoned restraint in an effort to recapture their share of the market. In the process, prices collapsed from about 28 dlrs a barrel to below nine dlrs, until the organisation decided to cut production again from last September onwards. Saudi output in 1985 had been the lowest since the 1960s. Production of natural gas liquids in 1986 declined slightly to 304,178 bpd from 316,310, said the report, carried on the official Saudi Press Agency. The increase in reserves came despite a sharp cut in the number of wells Aramco drilled to 33 in 1986 from 103 in 1985. Aramco's only refinery, at Ras Tannurah, processed 142.44 mln barrels (390,246 bpd) of crude last year. The plant was upgraded to a capacity of 530,000 bpd during the year, enabling it to supply 50 pct of local demand for oil products, the report said. The country's other five, smaller refineries -- owned by another state-owned oil organisation, Petromin -- produced around 750,000 bpd last year. Sulphur production rose to 1.23 mln tonnes in 1986 from 998,707 tonnes in 1985. During the year the company began operating a sulphur granule plant with capacity of 4,000 tonnes per day, the report said. Aramco said it awarded 1,303 contracts last year worth 1.4 billion riyals -- about 370 mln dlrs."

ghana lifts rice/maize import ban due to drought,grain corn rice,"Ghana has lifted a ban on rice and maize imports due to crop problems caused by unusually dry weather, the official Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported today. Secretary for Finance and Economic Planning Kwesi Botchwey made the announcement last night while accepting 7,891 tonnes of rice worth about four mln dlrs under a Japanese food aid programme. The lifting of the ban, imposed earlier this year, follows government concern over ""lower than average rainfall in southern Ghana and its implications for the major harvest."" Botchwey said rain has been lacking in major cereal growing areas throughout the south this year. The Ministry of Agriculture has predicted a fall of at least 25 pct in all major staple crops including maize, rice and cassava. GNA quoted Botchwey as saying that while the consequences of current reduced rainfall will be nowhere near the drought experiences of 1982/83 the government has taken steps to alleviate anticipated food production shortfalls. The failure of seasonal rains has already seriously affected drinking water supplies, farming and fishing in parts of the Central and Volta regions of Ghana where rivers have dried up."
failure of ec farm price talks disrupts tenders,grain wheat,"There will be no serious bids at European Community open market tenders for wheat and barley until EC farm ministers agree to the 1987/88 farm price package, trade sources said. The failure of farm ministers this week to come to an agreement resulted in no bids at this week's tender for export subsidies and traders said bids are unlikely as long as the uncertainty remains. One trader said permanent damage to export prospects can be avoided if an agreemend can be reached soon, but the situation will become more serious as time passes. However, traders said there seem to be few buyers around, lessening the disruptive impact of the delay. Poland and South Korea, who are in the market for feed wheat, will be offered intervention grain through special tenders, traders said."
fed expected to arrange system repurchases,interest money-fx,"The Federal Reserve is likely to add temporary reserves to the banking system this morning by executing system repurchase agreements, economists said. The Fed faces a need to add a large volume of reserves this statement period to offset a drain caused by rising Treasury balances at the Fed after the June 15 tax date. Most economists are predicting over-the-weekend system repurchases. But some, who see a smaller adding requirement, are forecasting a less aggressive combination of three- and six-day repos. Fed funds were trading at 6-3/4 pct, close to yesterday's 6.81 pct average."

This is the second French soft wheat export sale for the 1987/88 season which starts on July 1 and follows a Brazilian purchase of 150,000 tonnes. France sold around 300,000 tonnes of soft wheat to Tunisia during the 1986/87 season."

She said USDA has notified Australia, which assured it that stricter controls would be implemented. The Australian government had already imposed residue controls and it is believed the meat with the presticide residues was already in the pipeline before the controls were put in place, the spokeswoman said. There have been five other cases of Australian meat which had residue levels above U.S. allowable limits this year, she said."

"malaysia to research tin, wary on veg oils tax",tin veg-oil palm-oil alum,"Malaysia is to urge fellow tin producing countries to contribute more money towards research into new uses for the metal, Malaysian primary industries minister Lim Keng Yaik told Reuters in an interview. Lim, in Brussels on a tour of Europe and America, said he had instructed Malaysia's representatives on the executive committee of the Association of Tin Producing Countries, ATPC, to draw up a paper on the matter. Lim earlier met European Community farm commissioner Frans Andriessen and industry commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes. He said though it now appeared likely Commission proposals for a tax on vegetable and marine oils and fats would be defeated, he feared the Commission would revive the idea. Lim noted Andriessen this week promised that if the tax was adopted and third countries suffered export losses as a result, they would be compensated through access to the EC for alternative exports. ""Since most of our products are commodity based, I cannot see how this would work out in our case,"" Lim said. Malaysian palm oil exports to the EC are worth about 250 mln dlrs a year. The tin research proposal would be presented at an ATPC meeting to be held in Kuala Lumpur in September. ""Not enough research and development effort has been put in by tin producers and we have been pushed out by substitutes such as aluminium, paper and plastics,"" Lim said. He mentioned the use of inorganic tin in pesticides as an exciting possible new application. Lim said he could not estimate the amount of extra money which needed to be spent on research into new uses before the new paper was produced. He said Narjes told him there appeared no fundamental barriers to EC states quickly ratifying the new International Rubber Agreement, INRA, although translations of the accord into some EC languages are still being awaited. Lim, who will sign and ratify the agreement on Malaysia's behalf when he visits New York during his current tour, said it was important there should not be a long ""interregnum"" between the old agreement lapsing in October and the new one coming into force. He described the present accord as a model for commodity agreements due to its being signed by nearly all producing and consuming countries and by virtue of its review systems and control over buffer stock management."
ccc credit guarantees to el salvador reallocated,rice grain meal-feed,"The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) has reallocated 1.3 mln dlrs in credit guarantees originally granted to cover the sale of protein meals to El Salvador so it may buy rice, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. The action reduces the guarantee line authorized for sales of protein meals to 12.7 mln dlrs and creates a rice credit guarantee line of 1.3 mln dlrs, the department said. All sales under the credit guarantee lines must be registered and exports completed by September 30, the department said."
international lpg prices steady in quiet market,crude pet-chem propane,"International LPG prices were little changed in the past week, barely affected by the excitement on the advent of OPEC's mid-year meeting, traders and industry sources said. ""If the OPEC decides to increase crude oil production,"" a traders said, ""LPG supplies will be up without corresponding rise in demand."" Petrochemical buyers were sidelined, after their foray in the market early in june, they said. An industry meeting in Dublin this week also drew many market participants away from the trading desk, they added. Algeria has moved at least two cargoes of propane to the U.S. Gulf, keeping Mediterranean prices steady, traders said. In the Mideast Gulf, propane appeared easing slightly, after a major U.S. oil company bought propane on formula which netted back about 123 dlrs, cif Mideast Gulf, which was two dlrs below Saudi Arabia's government selling price (gsp), industry sources said. Delivered propane to Japan was quoted at gsp plus 19 dlrs and butane at gsp plus 25 dlrs, the traders said."
kuwait seen wanting to lease some u.s. tankers,ship crude,"The United States said Kuwait was discussing plans to lease privately-owned U.S. tankers to transport oil through the Gulf in addition to putting some of its own vessels under American flags. State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley, who made the disclosure about the tankers, also told reporters the United States expects to conclude very soon a favorable arrangement with Saudi Arabia concerning expanded security cooperation in the Gulf. The two developments occur as the Reagan administration continued to come under fire in Congress for its plans to bring 11 Kuwaiti tankers under American flags. The move is designed to protect the tankers from Iranian attacks and ensure freedom of navigation in the strategic waterway but has raised fears on Capitol Hill that it will draw the United States into the seven-year-old Iran-Iraq War. ""The Kuwaitis have discussed the possibility of chartering U.S. flag vessels with the Maritime Administration,"" Oakley said. She emphasized, however, that ""if some charter arrangement could be worked out, it would not supplant the reflagging arrangement that we worked out with the Kuwaitis."" In both cases, the ships would be eligible for U.S. Navy escort in the Gulf, she said. The Washington Post today quoted John Gaughan, administrator of the Martime Administration, as saying Kuwait has approached an American shipping company about the possibility of a charter. Gaughan said that earlier this week he told representatives of the company, whose identify he did not know, that chartered vessels flying the U.S. flag ""would be protected,"" the newspaper reported. Concerning Saudi Arabia, Oakley said ""we are moving forward in our talks ... on how we can tailor our efforts and security cooperation to facilitate our Gulf operations."""
noranda brunswick miners vote monday on contract,zinc lead,"Noranda Inc said 1,100 unionized workers at its 63 pct-owned Brunswick Mining and Smelter Corp lead-zinc mine in New Brunswick would start voting Monday on a tentative contract pact. Company official Andre Fortier said ""We are hopeful that we can settle without any kind of work interruption."" Fortier added that Brunswick's estimated 500 unionized smelter workers were currently meeting about a Noranda contract proposal and would probably vote next week. The mine's contract expires July 1 and the smelter's on July 21. The Brunswick mine produced 413,800 tonnes of zinc and 206,000 tonnes of lead last year at a recovery rate of 70.5 pct zinc and 55.6 pct lead. Concentrates produced were 238,000 tonnes of zinc and 81,000 tonnes of lead."
italy deficit not due to liberalization-minister,trade bop,"Italy's Foreign Trade Minister Mario Sarcinelli, commenting on speculation in the Italian press, said a sharp balance of payments deficit in May could not be attributed to recent moves liberalizing the purchase of foreign securities. Sarcinelli was reacting to suggestions that last month's overall 3,211 billion lire deficit, which compares with April's 2,040 billion surplus, could be linked to a May 13 decree abolishing obligatory non-interest-bearing deposits on foreign securities purchases. ""The deficit can be better attributed to premature and delayed foreign trade payments and receipts (leads and lags) rather than capital outflow to portfolio investment,"" Sarcinelli said in a statement. Earlier today the newspaper La Repubblica cited remarks by the Bank of Italy, which announced the deficit for May and said it had been partly caused by ""non-banking capital outflows."" ""In practice, it seems that there has been a constant flow of capital to foreign securities or investments outside our borders,"" said the newspaper. But the newspaper added that it was still not possible to say how far the move to abolish foreign securities purchase deposits had affected Italy's balance of payments."
no cominco strike talks scheduled,lead zinc,"Cominco Ltd said no talks were scheduled with striking workers at its Trail smelter and Kimberley, British Columbia lead-zinc mine. A company spokesman said the company and union met informally Tuesday but talks did not constitute a formal bargaining session. The last formal talks were on June 5. The workers went on strike May 9 and production has been shut down since then. The Trail smelter produced 240,000 long tons of zinc and 110,000 long tons of lead last year. The Sullivan mine at Kimberley produced 2.2 mln long tons of ore in 1986, most for processing at the Trail smelter."
oil markets show respect for new opec accord,crude fuel naphtha,"OPEC has shown itself to be in control of the world oil situation with its speed in hammering out a pact to limit crude oil output to 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987, oil traders said. They said market respect for the cartel has increased since it announced Saturday that it would cut fourth quarter output to 16.6 mln bpd from the 18.3 mln agreed in December. ""There are light oversupplies now, but OPEC ... Has ensured there will be no oversupplies in the fourth quarter, and is in effect putting pressure on end-users,"" a European crude oil trader said. In Tokyo, one oil analyst said, ""There's no reason to expect a weak market from now on."" A Japanese oil trader, also based in Tokyo, said, ""We thought OPEC would have difficulty agreeing on fourth quarter production so the market will react very bullishly."" Traders in Singapore said that while there has been only a slight increase so far in spot quotes for Dubai, a benchmark crude, they expect price increases over the next few days. August Dubai was discussed in cautious early activity at around 17.35 dlrs, above Friday's 17.15-20 range, but still below the government selling price (GSP) of 17.42. Even prices of light Mideast grades, such as Qatar and Abu Dhabi crudes, are expected to improve from recent weak positions, 15 to 20 cents below their GSP's. Singapore traders said sellers might now aim for GSP's at least. They said that after initial jumps, they expect prices to stabilise and hover around GSPs for the next few months. They said the Japanese oil market would be most affected and Japanese end-users would need to rebuild stocks for winter requirements before October. Prices are most likely to rise in the fourth quarter on European and U.S. Stockbuilding for winter, they added. ""There's no doubt consumption will be higher than production by the fourth quarter and stocks are not that high,"" said an international trader in Tokyo. Another Tokyo trader was less bullish, ""For sure there will be some shortage but it depends on how much they (OPEC members) cheat."" A Singapore trade source said, ""There is enough cheating and leakage in the OPEC sales system to convince traders there is no need to worry about shortages."" Other traders said the questionable Iraqi production level, after Iraq's rejection of its assigned quota, was a bearish factor to be considered. Traders also said end-users now would buy as much as possible on term contracts and buy spot only when the market cooled from its initial reaction to the OPEC agreement. Spot product prices in Singapore were little changed in thin early discussions, with naphtha and middle distillates quiet on minimal buying interest. Fuel oil products were steady to firm on light demand and tight prompt supplies, dealers said."
norway central bank sells crowns to ease pressure,money-fx nkr,"Norway's central bank sold crowns in the open market in a bid to ease strong upward pressure on the currency, which threatens to rise above set levels in a basket of currencies, dealers said. The central bank declined comment, but dealers noted the bank had also intervened and sold small amounts of crowns on Friday. The bank is committed to defending the crown at certain levels in a basket of 14 trade-weighted currencies. ""They've been in again this morning, selling piecemeal whenever they think necessary,"" a senior dealer at an Oslo bank, who declined to be identified, told Reuters. The crown's index is currently around 109.60 in the basket -- close to its upper limit of 109.50 which the central bank is committed to defending. A low index figure indicates a high value for the crown. The limit at the other end of the scale is set at 114.50. The crown has been bolstered by high Norwegian interest rates, currently around 16 pct in the money market, and better than expected economic indicators which showed a sharply reduced foreign trade deficit in May and inflation stabilising around the current annual rate of 10 pct."
polish farm prices and costs to rise from july,grain wheat oilseed rapeseed,"Polish farmers will receive price rises ranging from 13.4 pct for some crops to 23.3 pct for meat from July 1, the Finance and Agriculture ministries said. The state procurement price for rape will rise 13.4 pct to 5,500 zloties per quintal, while wheat and rye will go up an average 18.2 pct to 3,100 and 2,400 zloties per quintal. Pork will rise by 18.8 pct and beef 23.3 pct. The ministries said the new prices aimed to ensure farmers' profits and meet higher living costs. But at the same time they said fertilisers would rise by an average 50 pct, animal feeds by 38 pct and tractors by 25 pct."
canada threatens ban on danish pigmeat imports,trade livestock hog,"Canada has threatened to stop imports of Danish pigmeat from July 14 after Canadian veterinary inspectors approved only two of 33 slaughterhouses, a Danish agriculture ministry official told Reuters. The Canadians postponed the original July 1 deadline at the request of the European Commission, which Denmark approached for support. Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen said in an interview with the daily Berlingske Tidende: ""Denmark will not accept a ban on Danish meat exports, and I am sure we can reach an understanding with the Canadians with the help of the EC."" Danish pigmeat exports to Canada were worth 106 mln crowns in 1986, while Canadian exports to the European Community totalled about 6.5 billion U.S. Dlrs. Some Danish slaughterhouse officials expressed suspicion that the Canadian action was in response to tightening up by EC veterinary inspectors on Canadian food exports to the EC. But an official at the Canadian embassy in Copenhagen said the inspection of Danish slaughterhouses was based on EC regulations. ""Canadian officials are very concerned about the trade implications. We are holding active discussions with the EC and bilaterally,"" she added."
ivory coast weather no problem for 1986/87 crops,cocoa cotton coffee,"Ivory Coast rainfall this season has been less than in previous years, but 1986/87 cocoa and coffee production has not suffered, the official Ivorian daily Fraternite Matin reported. The newspaper did not speculate on whether recent dry conditions seriously threatened the main 1987/88 cocoa crop. Trade sources said the weather up to now could be irrelevant if there is good rainfall in coming weeks. Precipitation during the present campaign has been lowest in northern savannah regions, where the cotton crop has especially benefitted from the dry weather, Fraternite Matin said. Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon said earlier this month 1986/87 cotton output would be a record 213,506 tonnes, compared with 190,000 tonnes in 1985/86. Fraternite Matin said the mainstays of Ivorian agriculture had been little affected by the dry weather. Coffee does not need very much water to survive and only old cocoa plants have been affected in some regions, it added. London-based dealer Gill and Duffus recently forecast 1986/87 Ivory Coast cocoa output at a record 590,000 tonnes, which compares with 585,000 estimated for 1985/86. It described early development of the new main crop as patchy. The U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) earlier this year forecast a drop in 1986/87 coffee production in the Ivory Coast due to drought in the western part of the country. It estimated the crop at 3.84 mln bags compared with the previous year's 4.33 mln bag harvest. Ivorian officials have only described this year's coffee crop as ""normal."""

"danish crops two weeks behind, official report",grain rye wheat barley oat oilseed rapeseed sugar,"Danish crops are up to two weeks behind normal growth levels due to the cold weather in May and June, when mean temperatures were up to four centigrade below average, the State Plant Cultivation Bureau said in a report. At the season's first crop test on June 26, the bureau rated crops at an overall 94, the same as on June 20 last year. The figure of 100 represents normal in a year of average growth conditions with no crop damage. The test gave ratings expressed as a factor of 100, as follows - winter wheat 96 (last year 91), winter rye 97 (98), winter barley 92 (90), spring barley 94 (98), oats 96 (98), fodder and sugar beets 87 (96), winter rapeseed 98 (94), spring rapeseed 94 (98). Final harvest figures for 1986 were not yet available."
india relaxes rules for export promotion,trade tea coffee cotton castor-oil,"The Reserve Bank of India, RBI, announced new rules to allow exporters of 25 products to use foreign exchange up to 10 pct of their firm's total annual export earnings for export promotion abroad. The move is designed by the government to improve India's trade deficit. Products eligible for the new Blanket Exchange Permit Scheme include tea bags, cigarettes, coffee, leather, various textiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, plastics, engineering and electronic goods, ready-made garments, processed food, sports goods, fabricated mica and consultancy services. The scheme replaces current rules which allow different amounts of foreign exchange to be used only when firms attain a minimum annual turnover prescribed for each product. RBI said under the new rule, 16 other products will qualify, on a discretionary basis, for overseas promotional spending of not more than two pct of the freight-on-board value of annual export earnings. These include oil cakes, cereals, raw cotton, raw and semi-processed leather, gems, castor and sandalwood oil, psyllium husks and seeds, opium and various mineral ores. RBI said exporters of products not covered by either of the two groups will be eligible to use up to five pct of their freight-on-board value of their annual export earnings. Industry sources said the new entitlements, considerably higher than the previous limits, are also more flexible because holders of new permits no longer need to frequently apply to RBI for release of foreign exchange for export purposes."
chances of direct u.s.-iran gulf clash seen low,ship crude,"U.S. moves to increase its warships in and around the Mideast Gulf could trigger more attacks on unprotected merchant ships but run little risk of sparking a direct military clash with Iran, diplomats said. They said the American decision inevitably carries some risk of armed confrontation, but Iran -- despite its blunt rhetoric -- would want to avoid this as much as Washington. ""As Iran knows very well, what America is bringing into the Gulf could do serious damage,"" said one western diplomat. Diplomats see the greatest potential danger in more attacks on ""soft targets"" such as merchant shipping not protected by American or other western navy vessels patrolling the Gulf. The risk of Iranian attack on U.S. Warships or Kuwaiti oil tankers carrying the U.S. Flag and under naval escort is rated by diplomats as low. However, ""There is the threat that the Iranians, seeing these heavily protected U.S.-flag tankers, will go for softer targets,"" one diplomat said. Tehran Radio quoted Iran's top defence spokesman Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani as saying yesterday that Washington was ""moving to the brink of an armed encounter with us."" The U.S. is increasing its Gulf fleet from seven to 10 warships and sending the refurbished battleship Missouri to patrol just outside the Strait of Hormuz. The build-up ties in with U.S. plans to start escorting Kuwaiti oil tankers next month, which have been re-registered to fly the American flag to give them naval protection. Shipping serving Kuwait has come under repeated attack by Iran, angered at the emirate's war backing of Iraq. Concern in the region has mounted over the threat posed by Chinese-made Silkworm missiles, which the U.S. says Iran is preparing to deploy near the Strait of Hormuz. The Missouri, with its four-escort flotilla, is likely to make Iran think twice about using the missiles, diplomats said. A military source in the Gulf has said Iran also set up a launching site for the Silkworms on captured Iraqi soil in the Faw peninsula, within range of Kuwait. ""But anything that went as far as a direct attack on Kuwaiti territory would be a very serious escalation"" likely moving world opinion against Iran, remarked one. Some diplomats believe Iran could also consider carrying out reprisals against the United States outside the Gulf. Rafsanjani, who is also parliamentary leader, predicted last Friday ""a river of blood"" throughout the world in the event of any U.S. strike against Iran. Western diplomats said Iran, which Washington has accused of being behind state-sponsored terrorism, had no demonstrable capacity to carry out attacks in the U.S. itself. Diplomats saw few potential targets in Lebanon now that most Americans have left in the wake of kidnappings linked to pro-Iranian groups. But Europe and Asia were potential trouble-spots, and Kuwait was one of the most obvious targets. Any backlash was likely to take the form of sabotage or other action to make it difficult to blame Iran, they added."

"rains help u.s. western corn belt, more seen",grain corn oilseed soybean,"Weekend rain over the Western Corn Belt brought further relief to crop areas that had been dry earlier this month, and developing weather patterns will bring welcome moisture to central and eastern belt locations this week, according to Dale Mohler, senior meteorologist for Accu-Weather Inc. ""There is going to be more rain for the next two, three days,"" he said. ""We're in a fairly wet pattern with normal to above normal moisture this week."" Mohler said rainfall averaged 1/2 inch across southern Minnesota, 3/4 inch over southwest Iowa, one inch in eastern Nebraska and 1-1/2 inches in south-central Nebraska. Illinois fields saw virtually no rain over the weekend but were receiving scattered thundershower activity today, he said. Rain patterns will move across Indiana to Ohio with thudershower activity yielding to more general rains, he said. ""Tomorrow, that eastern area will get 1/4 to one inch, a pretty good rain,"" Mohler said. Rain was heavier than expected over the weekend, sparking an early selloff in soybean futures at the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices were off 14 to 20-1/2 cents with November off 19-1/2 cents at 5.43-1/2 dlrs. Mohler said the cold front now over the eastern belt is expected to move over the central Midwest, then move north later in the week. That could bring new rain patterns across the Corn Belt and assure good crop conditions as early-developed corn moves into the crucial pollination stage in early July, he said."
u.s.congressman to see reagan on gulf reflagging,ship crude,"U.S. House Speaker Jim Wright said he would question President Reagan tomorrow about his plan to protect Kuwaiti oil tankers with U.S. warships from attacks by Iran in the Gulf. House and Senate Democrats, who control Congress, have been critical of Reagan's plan but have not decided how or if they should try to pass legislation to prohibit it. Wright, a Texas Democrat, told reporters the Administration had gone ahead with plans to reflag the Kuwaiti tankers as U.S. ships without asking Congressional leaders for their advice."

U.S. Minerals said the new Montana Tunnels Mine near Helena, Mont, is expected to reach full production in August 1987. U.S. Minerals said the mine is designed to operate at an average of 12,500 tons or ore per day and is projected to produce 95,000 ounces of gold in 1988, plus significant quantities of silver, lead and zinc. U.S. Minerals said it has a 50 pct net profit royalty interest in the mine after payback of development costs."
"pakistan allows private cotton, rice exports",grain rice cotton,"The Pakistani government allowed the private sector to export cotton and rice in a new trade policy announced to cover the next three years. Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a televised speech it was also decided to allow duty-free import of cotton yarn. Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which have been handled exclusively by state corporations since early 1970s. Haq said now the private sector would export cotton and rice along with the state corporations. He said duty-free import of cotton yarn was allowed to make high quality yarn available to local ancillary industries and to enable them to compete effectively in the world market. This would help overcome domestic shortages of yarn, he said."
venezuela lowers exchange rate for oil earnings,money-fx crude,"Venezuela's cabinet approved a new exchange rate for oil and mining export earnings, setting it at 14.50 bolivars to the dollar from 7.50 bolivars previously, Minister Manuel Azpur UA said. Azpur told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the measure is ""fundamental to conserving the economic and financial strength of the petroleum industry."" He said the new exchange rate, which goes before the central bank for final approval tommorrow, will allow the state oil company Petroleos De Venezuela, S.A.(PDVSA) to solve its problem of working capital and implement investment plans, estimated at 20 billion bolivars for 1987. He did not say when the measure would become effective. Venezuela's oil industry previously sold its dollar earnings to the government at 7.50 to the dollar but bought foreign exchange from its imports at 14.50 bolivars. The new exchange rate will promote purchases of domestic goods and services by the industry, Azpur said. He added that it would also put PDVSA in a position to purchase more government debt bonds. PDVSA had available liquid assets of 20 billion bolivars at the start of this year, of which nine billion were in a trust fund in the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) and placed in government bonds. According to a contract between PDVSA and the central bank, the BCV must provide cash as the oil industry requries by repurchasing the bonds. PDVSA's contribution to the treasury last year was 44.480 billion bolivars. It foreign earnings for oil and petrochemcial sales were 8.023 billion dlrs."
interest rates hurt u.s. may housing sales,interest housing,"Sales of new single-family homes tumbled 14.9 pct in May from April levels because of higher mortgage interest rates, analysts said. ""There should be another month or two of very weak new home sales but with interest rates stabilizing, sale of new homes should become more stable by mid-summer,"" said economist Lawrence Chimerine of Wharton Econometrics Inc. The drop in May, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 616,000 units, was the largest since January 1982, the Commerce Department said. Interest rates on conventional mortgages bottomed out at about 9.08 pct in March and rose to about 10.7 pct in April, according to Stephen Roach, economist at Morgan Stanley. The effect was to freeze some potential new homebuyers out of the market, he and others said. ""The rates moved very suddenly and were certainly unexpected by homebuyers,"" said Cynthia Latta, an economist with Data Resources. ""They were so startled, they wanted to hold back and see what would happen."" The drop in sales of new single-family home sales was sharper than expected, some economists said. ""We fully expected a decline but the extent was more than we anticipated,"" said James Christian, chief economist for the U.S. League of Savings Institutions. Christian said there was a sharp rise in May in sales of existing homes, which are generally less expensive than new homes. Latta of Data Resources said strong sales of new condominiums in the Northeast and on the West Coast were reflected in sales of existing but not new homes. Christian of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions said, ""Underlying housing demand remains strong. I think the market is going to stabilize and give us a good second half."" Others were less optimistic, however. ""We clearly won't have a boom (in new home sales) but I don't think this is the start of a collapse in single-family housing,"" said Chimerine of Wharton. Eugene Sherman, chief economist of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, said, ""The lower sales level will be maintained for awhile until there is another change in rates. There won't be much specific improvement in coming months."""
henley <heng.o> has venezuelan refinery project,crude naphtha pet-chem,"Henley Group Inc's M.W. Kellogg Co subsidiary said it in consortium with <Inelectra> received a contract from Corpoven S.A., a Venezuelan-owned domestic oil company, to revamp and expand its El Palito Refinery. Kellogg said the installed cost of the work to be performed is estimated to be 130 mln dlrs. Inelectra, Kellogg said, is a major Venezuelan engineering firm. Kellog said the project will enable the refinery to produce BTX products -- benzene, toluene, and orthoxylene -- by processing naphtha feed from an expanded reformer-hydrotreater. Kellogg said the refinery's reformer-hydrotreater will be upgraded to 9,500 barrels a day capacity from 7,500. It said the new BTX process units include aromatic extraction, xylene fractionation, xylene isomerization and thermal hydrodealkylation. Kellogg pointed out that Venezuela now imports all of its BTX aromatics."
israel minister sees increased exports to u.s.,trade trade,"Israel's exports to the U.S. can and must double over the next five years if the mideast nation's goal of economic independence is to be achieved, said Gad Yaacobi, Israeli minister of Economy and Communication. Speaking before an American-Israel Chamber of Commerce seminar, Yaacobi said that in 1986 Israeli exports to the U.S. were over 2.3 billion dlrs or about one-third of Israel's total exports, while imports from the U.S. were around 1.8 billion dlrs or roughly one-sixth of the total. ""I am convinced that Israel exports to the U.S. can reach five billion dlrs in the next five years, if we learn to function in the American marketplace and place greater emphasis on product quality,"" Yaacobi said. While the weakening of the dollar vis-a-vis European currencies is a ""bottleneck to increasing exports to the U.S.,"" Yaacobi said he expects Israel to extend its recent trend toward higher U.S. exports. In the last ten years, Israeli exports to the U.S. rose fivefold, from 417 mln dlrs to 2.3 billion in 1986, while imports rose from 888 mln dlrs to 1.8 billion last year. Yaacobi said export growth must increase ten to eleven pct annually, the rate achieved until the 1973 Yom Kippur War. He said that the U.S./Israel Free Trade agreement, passed last year and eliminating all duties and other commercial restrictions between the two nations through 1994, would continue to facilitate the desired export growth. Dual agreements included in the FTA allow Israel to act as an economic bridge between the U.S. and Europe, enabling U.S. firms to export to Europe at lower cost if a certain percentage of the exported is produced in Israel, and vice-versa. Yaacobi said that tensions among the nations of the middle east was one of the main reasons Israel had not yet been able to achieve its economic potential. Since 1973 the U.S. has given Israel 25 billion dlrs in aid, but most of it went to defense expenditures and financing military conflicts ""which were imposed on Israel,"" he said. Short of achieving Israel's full growth potential, however, Yaccobi said it would still be possible to achieve economic independence by 1993 or 1994, based on the assumption that exports can be doubled from 1986 levels in that time period."
pakistan unveils new trade policy to boost exports,trade grain rice cotton,"Pakistani government allowed freer cotton and rice export in a three-year new trade policy aimed at narrowing the country's yawning trade gap. Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a televised speech the government had also decided to allow duty-free import of cotton yarn to make the textile industry more competitive, and to link bulk tea imports to the export of Pakistani products. Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which have been handled exclusively by state corporations since early 1970s. But Haq said now the private sector would also export cotton and rice along with the corporations, which meets a long-standing demand of the local traders. The duty-free import of cotton yarn has been allowed to bring down prices and help the local ancillary industries compete effectively in the world market, he said. Haq said the new policy, effective from the fiscal year 1987/88 beginning on July 1, would be for three years but reviewed every year. It was a departure from the previous practice of announcing trade policies for a single fiscal year, and Haq said it would enable the businessmen to plan their market strategies over a longer period. He said an export credit of 250 mln dlrs had been provided for the export of engineering goods to selected third world countries on soft credit terms. Pakistan's 1986/87 exports at 3.6 billion dlrs, 18.2 per cent more than in the previous year, and imports at 5.23 billion dlrs compared to 5.63 billion dlrs in 1985/86. He said the government policy was to rationalise and streamline import controls. ""It has been observed that due to restrictions on imports, specially on raw materials and intermediate goods, local industry has been suffering for want of necessary inputs,"" he said. ""Prices have been on the increase and quality of goods produced has been low. This restrictive policy also gave rise to smuggling and hampering of exports."" He said that to correct this situation, 136 items had freed from import restrictions. Previously, Pakistan has met its trade gap largely from remittances from its nationals working abroad, mainly in the Gulf. However, the remittances have begun to fall after the drop in oil prices in recent years leading to the spectre of a balance of payments crisis for Pakistan."
japan understands u.s. attack on iran oil platform,crude ship,"Japan said it understood why the U.S. Attacked an Iranian oil platform on Monday. ""Japan, deeply concerned over the increasing threat to the ships navigating in the Gulf, understands the circumstances that have led the United States government to take these measures,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. The statement added that the threat to free and safe navigation had increased after the missile attack on a U.S.-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti territorial waters last Friday."

"world could cope with hormuz closure, subroto says",crude ship,"Oil prices would skyrocket for a time if conflict in the Gulf closed the Strait of Hormuz, but oil supplies could be adjusted to take care of world demand, Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said. He made no explicit reference to the latest U.S. Military action in the Gulf. But in an address to a conference of the Indonesian Petroleum Association, he said, ""If worst comes to worst and say the flow of oil through the Straits of Hormuz is completely shut off, I believe the world oil supply, given time to adjust, can take care of the situation."" ""But this is not to say that prices, at least for a short duration, will not skyrocket as speculators take advantage of the situation,"" he declared. Tensions in the Gulf, however, usually had a relatively short-term impact on prices, he added. Assessing future price trends, he said, ""Short-term spot prices will probably still fluctuate, but they will most likely hover around the official Opec price basket of 18 dlrs per barrel. ""The upward deviations, however, are likely to be greater than the downward ones."" ""The balance between supply and demand in the short term will still be delicate,"" he added. ""Non-Opec production may still go up, competing with Opec for the expected additional increase in world demand."" Subroto, a member of Opec's three-man quota committee which has been touring cartel members, said speculation may play havoc with spot prices, but Opec was trying to stabilize the situation by urging cooperation by non-Opec producers. In the medium term, non-Opec production would reach a plateau in the early 1990s, leaving Opec much stronger, he said."

indonesia finds new offshore oil and gas resources,crude nat-gas,"The Indonesian state-owned oil company Pertamina has found new offshore oil and gas resources in East Aceh, on the western tip of northern Sumatra, a company spokesman said. The spokesman said the discovery was made at the GOS IA-1 offshore exploratory well about 38 kms east of Langsa in Aceh. ""Oil and gas are found in sand layers at the depth of 2,300 metres within the Baong formation,"" he said. He said preliminary tests showed that the well could flow oil at the rate of 1,320 barrels a day with 50 degrees API at 20 degrees centigrade through a 5/8 inch choke. ""The well also flows natural gas at the rate of 12 mln standard cubic feet a day,"" he added. GOS IA-1 well, located at a water depth of 41 metres, was drilled under a production sharing contract between Pertamina and Japex North Sumatra Ltd, each having 50 pct shares. ""Petroleum operations are to be carried out by Pertamina as operator through a joint operating body established by the two companies,"" the Pertamina spokesman stated. The contract covers the Gebang block contract area. The two companies have previously completed the drilling of GOS IIA-1 exploratory well, around 14 kms south of GOS IA-1."
iran plans to file lawsuits over u.s. raid,crude ship,"Iran is preparing lawsuits to file for compensation from the U.S. Over the American raid on its Gulf oil platforms, Tehran radio quoted Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying. The lawsuits would be filed with competent international bodies once the exact damage was calculated, he was quoted telling a news conference in Tehran. He earlier estimated the damage from the U.S. Raid at about 500 mln dlrs. The rigs, one of which was heavily shelled by four American destroyers on Monday, were still burning almost 24 hours after the attack, he said. Aqazadeh said the half-billion-dollar damage estimate was preliminary. Washington has said the attack was in response to a missile strike against the American-flag tanker the Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday. He denied that there was any military hardware on the rigs ""except a 23 mm machinegun for air defence."" Reacting to Weinberger's remark that Washington considered the case closed, Aqazadeh said: ""Iran will also consider the case closed after its retaliatory measure."" Iranian officials have said their response would not be limited to the Gulf and U.S. Interests around the world might come under attack. Aqazadeh said the U.S. Military presence in the Gulf aggravated the regional crisis and made access to the region's oil more difficult, but he did not see the U.S. Attack significantly affecting oil prices. IRNA said he gave no explicit reply when asked if the attack would prompt Iran to block the Hormuz Strait at the entrance to the Gulf. ""If Iran cannot use the Hormuz Strait, no other country can either, and this would be to everyone's harm,"" the radio quoted him as saying."

"oilmeal demand still strong in u.s., soviet union",meal-feed soy-meal oilseed soybean sunseed rapeseed,"Oilmeal demand remained strong in the United States in July and August and six pct up on levels seen in the same months last year, with most of the rise coming in soymeal, the Hamburg based publication Oil World said. Total U.S domestic usage of the nine major oilmeals rose to a record 19 mln tonnes in October 1986/August 1987, up 4.2 pct on the same year-ago period, with the increase in soymeal at seven pct, it said. Soviet soymeal demand rose by 310,000 tonnes in July and 330,000 tonnes in August over the respective year-ago months following a huge increase in soymeal imports. Oil World presumed some imports were not used immediately but went into stocks. With imports again large in September, it estimated Soviet soymeal stocks sharply up at 800,000 tonnes by October 1 from around 130,000 at the same time last year. EC oilmeal demand rose 100,000 tonnes in August from a year earlier, with soymeal up 45,000 tonnes. Crushings of rapeseed, sunseed and soybeans will probably rise from last year due to bumper EC crops. It estimated the EC rapeseed crop at a record 5.9 mln tonnes, up from 3.7 mln last year. Rapeseed disposals were reported at 2.1 mln tonnes by September 20 against 1.4 mln at that time last year."
no pressing need for soviet wheat subsidy - lyng,grain wheat,"The Soviets have not indicated an urgent need for a U.S. wheat subsidy offer, and it is unlikely that such an offer will be ma during the U.S./Soviet summit expected to be held next month, Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng told Reuters. In an exclusive interview with Reuters, Lyng said he did not know if the United States will offer Moscow another wheat subsidy offer this year or when that offer will be made. ""Last year it was well into the year before we offered it. There's been nothing that's taken place to indicate to me that there's a pressing need on their part for that sort of deal (a wheat subsidy)."" When asked if a subsidy would be offered at a U.S./Soviet summit, Lyng said, ""No, I don't think so. I don't think that."" The Agriculture Secretary said a U.S. wheat subsidy deal to Moscow would not be the kind of topic appropriate for discussion at a summit. ""It would not be the kind of issue that the President or the Chairman would get into specific negotiations or discussions about,"" Lyng said. ""When Mr. Nikonov (communist party secretary for agriculture) was here ... he indicated that trade in wheat was not something that would be discussed with the President of the United States. He said it's not presidential,"" Lyng said. Lyng said uncertainties about wheat quality in some major producing areas of the world, volatile wheat prices and the still unfinished Soviet grain harvest could delay any final decision on the timing of another wheat subsidy to Moscow. The future of the U.S./Soviet long-term grains agreement will be discussed the first of next year, Lyng said, but the Agriculture Secretary questioned the benefits of the long-standing agreement. ""We've had three years in a row in which the Soviets have failed to live up to their end of the agreement ... We would love to continue to keep doing busines with the Soviet Union, but do we need a long-term agreement. Who benefits from that. These are some of the questions we need to discuss."" When asked if he felt the United States has benefitted from the agreement, Lyng said, ""I don't know. It certainly hasn't been what we had hoped it would be. For three years running they've (Moscow) failed to live up to what we considered was an agreement."""

iran leader vows revenge on us raid in coming days,crude ship,"Iran's top war spokesman Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani on Tuesday called the U.S. Attacks on two of its Gulf oil platforms an escalation and promised retaliation. ""God willing, we will carry out our duty in the coming days and make them sorry,"" said Rafsanjani in a speech to Parliament later broadcast by Tehran Radio. The Tehran leadership have been quick to threaten vengeance after the U.S. Raids on the rigs, one of which was destroyed. President Ali Khamenei, Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi and now Rafsanjani within 24 hours of the U.S. Action have all vowed retaliation. Rafsanjani, the parliamentary speaker, said, ""It is not a threat or an attempt at intimidation when we say we will respond to aggression -- it is a reality and we have proved it in practice."" He added that the American attack ""squares neither with its superpower image nor its claim of concern with security, nor reason and wisdom."" U.S. Warships shelled an Iranian offshore oil platform and American special forces boarded another, destroying equipment. The U.S. Government said the attack was a measured response to an Iranian missile attack on the American-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters last Friday."
lyng pleased ec to offer gatt farm proposal,trade soybean veg-oil,"U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said he is pleased the European Community plans to offer a global farm reform plan at GATT later this month, although the United States opposes key parts of the proposal. ""We're pleased that they have moved in tabling a proposal. It will help us in getting the negotiations underway,"" Lyng told Reuters in an interview Tuesday. Lyng's comment came after EC ministers in Luxembourg endorsed a farm reform package drafted by the EC Commission. The EC plan will be presented at the next meeting of Uruguay round agriculture negotiators in Geneva on October 26. Lyng said the United States would oppose parts of the plan seeking a market sharing agreement for grains, and proposing curbs on U.S. soybean and cereal substitute exports to Europe. The U.S. in July proposed to GATT the elimination of all farm subsidies affecting trade within ten years, and has pressed the EC to make a counter-offer with the aim of reaching a global farm subsidy agreement by the end of 1988. However, the EC and some U.S. domestic groups have said the Reagan administration plan to end all farm trade subsidies is unrealistic. Asked about such criticism, Lyng said ""The alternative to doing that is to say that we preserve them and maintain them. I think that is the unrealistic position."" ""I would suggest that they (EC) listen to what we are trying to say."" Lyng also rejected suggestions the U.S. and EC agree a freeze in export subsidies to get the GATT negotiations started. ""All that some countries would like to have would be a wheat agreement where we would stop export subsidies on wheat. That doesn't do a thing for us,"" Lyng said. The United States wants an end to subsidies in a range of agricultural products from dairy products to vegetable oils, he said. At the GATT negotiators meeting next week Canada is expected to offer a proposal as well as the EC. The United States will be represented at the meeting by former agriculture undersecretary Daniel Amstutz, recently appointed special U.S. negotiator on agriculture."

gatt case against japan a model for u.s. - lyng,trade carcass,"Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said the ruling of a GATT panel on a U.S. trade complaint against Japan, expected soon, may influence the U.S. stance in negotiations with Tokyo on beef and citrus import quotas. The ruling of a GATT tribunal on a U.S. demand that Japan end quotas on 12 categories of food items is expected by the end of the year. Lyng said he is optimistic the ruling will favor the U.S. ""These are quota items, and the principles that apply to them, it seems to me, will have some bearing on the question of whether you would have quotas or not on beef and citrus,"" Lyng told Reuters in an interview. He repeated the U.S. demand that Japan lift the quotas on beef and citrus after March 31, next year. The Japanese quotas on 12 food categories which the United States has challenged include items such as tomato paste, some cheeses and specialty fruit juices. U.S. officials had hoped a ruling against the quotas would be issued earlier this year but the GATT panel decision has been delayed by the illness of the tribunal's chairman. The U.S. has taken a hardline stance on the beef and citrus quotas, which Tokyo says must remain in place to protect Japanese farmers. ""We will not negotiate new quotas or accept new quotas (on beef and citrus). If they impose them we would consider that an illegal action in the GATT, Lyng said. He declined to say what action the U.S. would take next April if Japan continues to resist U.S. demands."
asa says ec oilseed policy illegal under gatt,oilseed soybean veg-oil trade,"The American Soybean Association (ASA) denounced European Community (EC) oilseed policies as illegal under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and threatened to make an unfair trade complaint if the EC does not remedy the situation. ASA Vice President James Adams told an ASA-sponsored Outlook 87 conference: ""It will be filed unless the EC takes drastic and immediate steps."" ""These subsidies are blatantly unfair and are GATT illegal, since they were established after the zero soybean duty was established in 1962,"" he said. The ASA's unfair trade petition against the EC would ask for an investigation and modification of EC oilseed policies to make the regime non-discriminatory. The EC in 1962 ruled all EC oilseed imports duty-free, in an effort to fill its oilseed needs. But EC oilseeds production has risen dramatically since then. The EC now guarantees oilseed prices to farmers above world market levels and is considering implementing a controversial oils and fats tax. The subsidies ""are obvious attempts to circumvent the zero duty binding and that makes U.S. Farmers mad as hell,"" Adams said. The ASA is confident the U.S. Congress will support its trade complaint, Adams said. The ASA also strongly opposes an EC proposal to tax vegetable and marine oils consumed in the EC, which will be considered by the EC Commission in December. U.S. Soybean world market share has declined 35 pct in volume and 40 pct in value since 1982, primarily as a result of EC policies, Adams added. Lord Plumb, European Parliament President and a speaker at the conference, said the EC expanded oilseed production in 1973 when the U.S. Halted overseas sales of soy products."
u.s. takes tough stand on gatt farm issues,trade livestock carcass sugar,"The United States is prepared to ""pull out all the stops"" to defend its agricultural trade rights under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), U.S. Ambassador to GATT Michael Samuels said. Those rights are now being challenged by the European Community's (EC) agricultural support policies, he told a conference sponsored by the American Soybean Association. He reiterated Washington's firm intention to retaliate if the EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef without the issue being investigated by a GATT special committee. The U.S. claims the EC directive, due to come into effect on January 1, threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of U.S. meat shipments into the EC. The U.S. also will oppose all EC efforts to impair U.S. trade via the EC oilseeds regime, which supports EC oilseed prices over the current market level and which may be extended to include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax, Samuels said. Reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies, an aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral trade negotiations, ""is meaningless if import barriers continue to be erected,"" Samuels said. Samuels called the U.S. plan to eliminate world farm subsidies by the year 2000, proposed at GATT in July, ""visionary"" and ""very serious."" The EC and Japan have said it is unrealistic. The EC Commission this month announced its draft proposal on farm trade reform, expected to be tabled at GATT formally next week. The EC scheme involves emergency measures to reduce tensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cereals substitutes, dairy and sugar. It also calls for reduction of farm subsidies. The U.S. Is not opposed to short-term measures, as long as they are directly linked to long-term commitments to end major trade distortions, Samuels said. Washington will review the EC proposal when it is formally submitted and respond to it officially then. ""We will consider its relation to the Punta del Este declaration to correct trade problems and expand market access,"" the U.S. Ambassador said. The U.S. can say no to the EC proposal if the EC ignores the U.S. plan when it tables its own proposal, he added. The key difference between the two approaches is that the U.S. wants farm subsidies eliminated, while the EC is pushing only for a reduction in farm suppports, Samuels said. If the EC farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze, there would be little incentive for the Community to work to correct the international trade situation, he added. Samuels cited the animal hormones complaint, the EC oilseeds regime and an EC regulation concerning meat imports to third countries as three crucial barriers to trade which the U.S. wants to see resolved under the auspices of GATT."
"us warns iran, begins escorting tanker convoy",ship crude,"The United States warned Iran again that it was ready to retaliate for any further hostile military action in the Gulf as U.S. warships began escorting another tanker convoy southward from Kuwait. U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said the U.S. sought no further Gulf hostitilies but was ready to deal with any Iranian response to Monday's attack on an Iranian oil rig. Several hours later, the Pentagon announced that U.S. warships had begun escorting two U.S. flag Kuwaiti tankers -- the 80,000 ton product carrier Ocean City and 46,000 ton liquified petroleum tanker Gas King -- southward from Kuwait. The Defense Department said the 12th such convoy of U.S. flagged Kuwaiti tankers through the Gulf began at 0230 EDT under the escort by the U.S. guided missile frigate Ford. It did not say what oth U.S. warships were in the area. ""It (the convoy) is now progressing uneventfully in the central Gulf,"" the Pentagon statement said. Asked on NBC's ""Today"" program if the United States was prepared for a major war with Iran, Weinberger said, ""Well we are prepared I think for whatever eventualities emerge from this situation but we don't look on it as a war."""
baker seen winning german interest rates battle,money-fx interest,"The United States appears to have won a transatlantic battle by forcing the Bundesbank to trim interest rates, European economists said. But they added Washington set the stakes high by testing the limits of the Louvre accord while global stock markets were plunging. West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker reaffirmed their commitment to currency stability at a secret meeting yesterday in Frankfurt, according to official statements released late Monday. Only 13 hours after the statements were released, the Bundesbank reduced short-term interest rates by offering banks liquidity at a fixed bid rate of 3.80 pct, down from a 3.85 pct facility rate offered last week. While the two ministers were meeting with Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl, the central bank had also added money market liquidity repeatedly, signalling it did not want a strong rise in the tender allocation rate on Tuesday. ""It's round one to the Americans, "" said Richard Reid, senior European economist for brokers UBS/Philips and Drew in London. But Reid added, ""We shouldn't forget that it has taken one of the biggest stock market crashes in decades to get the West Germans to cut their security repurchase rate by a 0.05 percentage point."" Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of earlier tightening of West German monetary policy led to a sharp dollar fall and fuelled speculation that the Louvre accord was no longer valid. Six leading industrial nations agreed under February's Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies and coordinate monetary policies. It has since been reaffirmed by the Group of Seven - the US, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada. The Frankfurt meeting on Monday soothed currency markets and the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours trading in New York. At the Frankfurt fixing on Tuesday, the dollar was quoted at 1.7918 marks compared with 1.7740 on Monday. Guenther Aschoff, chief economist at Deutsche Genossenschaftbank in Frankfurt said massive declines on world stock markets had been the main reason for the fall in West German short-term interest rates on Tuesday. ""The Bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock market losses... That was the responsible thing to do and if it fits with Baker's wishes, then all the better,"" he said. No central bank wants to let interest rates rise, and the Bundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following rises in the U.S., Aschoff said. Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday the central bank has no interest in higher capital market rates and he thought the global rate increase was a cause for concern. Giles Keating, economist with Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London said ""The cautious Bundesbank has beaten a retreat and Baker has won a battle...But he hasn't won the war as the security repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it was before the IMF meeting last month in Washington."" Before the IMF meeting, when the Louvre Accord was reaffirmed, the Bundesbank was offering money market liquidity at 3.60 pct, Keating noted. Economists said the United States now appeared to have agreed to play by the rules of the Louvre Accord and support the dollar in return for the German action on interest rates. Any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinder Washington's efforts to reduce its trade deficit, Stoltenberg told a news conference on Tuesday. He added he would not rule out central banks of leading industrial countries intervening on exchange markets to defend the dollar's value. Deutsche Genossenschaftbank's Aschoff stressed West Germany's heavy dependence on exports and the need for currency stability. In addition, both the U.S. And West German central banks were keen to avoid a dollar slide which would force them to again spend vast sums intervening to support the dollar."
ec agrees trade deal with argentina,trade livestock carcass grain wheat,"The European Community (EC) agreed a trade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the country following the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group, EC officials said. Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers, Argentina will gain additional trading rights on a series of products including meat, fish and cereals by-products. But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals with Canada and Japan and are due to study these again, the officials said. The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of EC states after West Germany withdrew objections to increased quotas for Argentina on high-quality beef. Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat, saying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals substitutes, but they were outvoted by the other states, the officials said. Under the deal, Argentina will benefit from improved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular the quota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4,500 tonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will be increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes. Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of 5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced levies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said. The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said that Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected their exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. They have been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade). But officials said ministers had been unable to resolve Canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain had been affected by the country's EC membership. Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on the fish dispute with Canada. Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan. The EC claims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group has improved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfied with Japanese offers of compensation. Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems on citrus fruits to aid EC exports, to improve tariffs for some other farm produce, to increase tariffs for leather footwear and to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal. EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq told journalists: ""We maintain our position that the (Japanese) concessions were not enough."" ""We hope that there will be an improvement,"" he said."

It said a state is recognized as tuberculosis-free if no case of the disease is diagnosed for at least five years and if the state complies with the uniform methods and rules of the state-federal cooperative eradication program. To achieve brucellosis-free status, a state's cattle population must remain uninfected for the previous 12 months. There are 33 states, plus the U.S. Virgin Islands, classified as free of bovine tuberculosis and 24 states, plus Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which have eradicated brucellosis. Only 20 states and the U.S. Virgin islands have eradicated both diseases, it noted."
"stoltenberg says criticism not ""one-way street""",interest money-fx,"Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said he was surprised by recent criticism of West German economic policies voiced by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker but added that the criticism was not purely one-sided. Stoltenberg told the West German Trade and Industry Association (DIHT) that before a meeting with Baker on Monday, ""There had been surprising notes of criticism (from the United States)."" He added. ""Criticism is not a one-way street."" He did not elaborate, but Bonn has often called on the U.S. To reduce its federal budget deficit. Over the weekend Baker had criticised West German economic policies, saying that rises in domestic interest rates here were not in the spirit of last February's Louvre pact to stabilise currencies. Stoltenberg told the DIHT that his meeting on Monday with Baker had resolved differences between the two countries. At a news conference earlier on Tuesday Stoltenberg had declined to comment specifically on Baker's criticisms, but he had said that after three hours of discussions on Monday, ""one remark or another has been clarified."""

spain appeals for ec help on maize imports,trade grain corn,"Spanish farm minister Carlos Romero, speaking at a meeting of EC farm ministers, called for action to help the Spanish maize market, Spanish diplomatic sources said. Spain is threatened with massive imports from third countries by the end of the year, they said. They said the imports are due to come in as a result of the accord by which the EC has promised the United States it will import two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum into Spain from third countries this year. Around a sixth of this tonnage has so far come in under a reduced levy system and the EC cereals management committee may decide this week to authorise the Spanish intervention board to make direct purchases. The sources said Romero urged that other EC countries should take some of the imports to prevent disturbance of the Spanish market. They said he threatened to withhold support for the EC Commission plan for new limits on farm output which if breached would mean price cuts unless Spain received some help. The sources said no direct reply was given to Romero at the meeting."

us diplomatic missions on high alert over gulf,crude ship,"The State Department says many U.S. diplomatic missions overseas are on high alert for possible retaliation from Iran for Monday's attack on two Iranian oil platforms by American forces in the Gulf. At the same time, the Pentagon announced on Tuesday that U.S. forces have begun escorting another Kuwaiti tanker convoy southward through the Gulf from Kuwait. The State Department renewed its warning to Americans not to travel to Iran because of what spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley called, ""its virulent anti-American policies and support for terrorism."" ""The threat to Americans has increased significantly,"" she said in announcing that the department was reiterating advice it last made in January. The department said about 2,600 American citizens live in Iran, the overwhelming majority dual nationalities. Oakley said no specific warning has been issued to U.S. diplomats and Americans living abroad in the aftermath of the U.S. attack on the oil drilling platforms, but ""many of our missions are on a high state of alert."""

The duty was imposed last year after the revenue department found U.S. corn production was subsidized. It is now up to the government to decide whether to change the duty."
treasury's baker under fire for wall street drop,money-fx interest,"As official Washington sought to restore investor confidence after Monday's Wall Street collapse, Treasury Secretary James Baker came under fire from critics who claimed he helped to precipitate the crisis. Baker's weekend blast at the West German Bundesbank for boosting interest rates seemed to signal an unraveling of an international accord to stabilize currency values. Nigel Lawson, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, was among those who said the treasury secretary's statements helped spur a wave of stock sales by making already jittery investors think that a clash between the two major economic powers would damage the world economy. Lawson told a London television interviewer Tuesday, ""I think the scale of the (stock) fall was very great. That, I think, was partly due to statements that have been made by senior figures on the other side of the Atlantic."" It was a dispute that should never have happened, he added. Although Baker appeared to patch over the rift at a hastily-called meeting with West German officials Monday, he still faced a storm of criticism on his return to the United States on Tuesday. Baker cut short a long-planned trip to Scandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis. Said one U.S. analyst of Baker's weekend remarks, ""His timing could not have been worse."" One government bond salesman in New York said, ""He actually thought that yelling at the Germans, and threatening to smack the dollar down would work. That doesn't show much understanding of international monetary gamesmanship."" However, some analysts said West Germany's stubborn march toward higher interest rates may have forced Baker's hand. ""On the surface Baker may look responsible for this, but if you go back to see what caused it (unsettling of financial markets), it was West German policy,"" said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International in New York. ""All Mr. Baker did was to mention the obvious in public, so making him responsible for it was a little like killing the messenger,"" he said. After Monday's talks, the U.S. and West German governments made it clear that the Louvre currency accord, pieced together in Paris in February, was still in effect. Wall Street feared that collapse of the agreement might be a prelude to hyper-inflation and economic malaise similar to the late 1970s. Analysts believe Monday's Wall Street crash wiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values. Treasury sources said that Baker, already unhappy about Bonn's refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep the global recovery moving, was angered by a Bundesbank interest rate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite. He felt that the U.S. recovery, inching along in its 59th month, could no longer be the only engine of global economic expansion. A growing U.S. economy has been serving as a huge market for debtor country exports. Moreover, Baker, the consummate politician, was worried that the Republican party might face next year's presidential election with its main showpiece -- a vibrant economy -- badly tarnished. A rise in global interest rates might worsen the debt crisis and completely choke off U.S. economic growth that has already slowed to a tepid 3.2 pct annual rate. ""There's no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on the economy, and it's important that the psychology turn around quickly, or else obviously the panic will feed on itself, and eventually there'll be a serious price to pay economically,"" former deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman said in a television interview. In many ways, the official response was mild. Washington was stunned by the sudden Wall Street retreat, with President Reagan speaking for most people by admitting that he was ""puzzled."" U.S. government sources said the secretary immediately returned to the Treasury to be briefed on market developments and, presumably, their political impact. For all of this, it seems unlikely that Baker's status in Washington will diminish because of the market fall. Asked by reporters if somebody's head should roll because of the Wall Street retreat, Texas Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen said with some irony, ""Oh, I think it's much too late to be doing that...You have an administration that's taken the attitude that we can put the country on automatic pilot and --- retire to the living room to take a nap. You just can't do that."""
"convoy runs gulf gauntlet, other ships stay clear",ship crude,"A new convoy of tankers escorted by American warships headed down the Gulf on Wednesday, towards Iranian oil platforms still oozing smoke after having being blasted by U.S. Navy raiders. Some Gulf sea captains were reported to be steering well clear of Iran's Silkworm missiles, however, and frontline emirate Kuwait redeployed air defences to counter the threat. ""I think the predominant feeling ... Is of being scared this conflict will escalate,"" a top West German Foreign Ministry official, Helmut Schaefer, told reporters in Bahrain after a tour of three Gulf states. b Shipping sources said on Tuesday night at least six sea captains had voiced fears that Iran would avenge Monday's U.S. Raids by unleashing more Silkworm missiles at ships plying the Gulf. Belgium decided two minesweepers en route for the Gulf would stay out for the time being following Monday's U.S. Action. But there was no sign that the prospect of more tit-for-tat assaults had reduced the level of shipping activity in the area. Iran, having vowed to react strongly after Monday's U.S. Action, launched a barrage of threats and ridicule. For its part, Washington warned Iran again on Tuesday that it was ready for any further hostile action. Pentagon officials then announced that a U.S. Guided missile destroyer began escorting two Kuwaiti tankers flying the U.S. flag southwards--the 80,000 tonne product carrier Ocean City and 46,000 tonne petroleum tanker Gas King."
senate backs u.s. retaliation in gulf,crude ship,"The U.S. Senate on Tuesday backed President Reagan's retaliatory strike against Iranian targets in the Gulf as it moved to take a greater role in making policy in the volatile region. Senators voted 92-1 for a non-binding measure that endorsed Monday's U.S. attack on two Iranian oil platforms in retaliation for an Iranian attack last Friday on a Kuwaiti ship flying the American flag. The measure said the attack was a firm indication of U.S. resolve that Iran ""cannot take military action against the United States with impunity."" Earlier, the Senate cut off Republican stalling tactics and set a vote on a measure that could give Congress a larger role in making Gulf policy. The measure, however, does not require Reagan to comply with the 1973 War Powers Act, which could lead to a pullout of U.S. forces from the Gulf. While Democrats and Republicans praised the U.S. retaliatory strike, many voiced new fears about the growing U.S. involvement in the Gulf and some demanded that Reagan comply with the War Powers Act."
baker/stoltenberg meeting soothes markets,money-fx dlr,"News of a meeting between U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker and West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg on Monday soothed currency markets, allowing the dollar to recoup much of the day's losses, dealers said. News of the meeting, which took place in Frankfurt in great secrecy, came after the dollar fell sharply on criticism by Baker of West German monetary policy, which had provoked fears that the Louvre pact on currency stability was in jeopardy. The dollar reacted immediately to the news, rising over two pfennigs in after hours New York trading, dealers there said. The announcement of the meeting, also attended by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, was made simultaneously in Bonn and Washington, timed for after the closure of New York markets. Baker, Stoltenberg and Poehl agreed to pursue the policies accepted under the February Louvre accord, a finance ministry spokesman in Bonn said. The dollar rose to 1.7970/90 marks from New York's close of 1.7730/40. It had closed there on Friday at 1.7975/85 marks. The dollar had tumbled nearly three pfennigs as the market reacted to Baker's criticism of rising West German interest rates, and stock markets crashed worldwide. Baker had said that West Germany was apparently breaching the Louvre accord. Under the accord, leading industrial democracies pledged to coordinate economic policies to foster currency stability, with the surplus countries, West Germany and Japan, stimulating their economies and the U.S. promising to cut its budget deficit. West German government sources said rising West German money market rates could not be seen as a breach of the Louvre pact. They were rather a direct reaction to higher interest rates in the United States. U.S. Bond yields have been rising since May on inflationary fears and in early September the Fed raised the discount rate to 6.00 pct from 5.50. German yields have also risen over this period, but less markedly, and since late September the Bundesbank has nudged up short-term rates by changing the terms on its security repurchase pacts, its principal instrument for steering the money market. The allocation rate on the last facility was 3.85 pct, compared with 3.60 pct. This was partly due to West Germany's inability to uncouple itself from U.S. interest rate trends, but also reflected concern among monetary conservatives in the Bundesbank central bank council about excessive monetary growth, which raised fears of domestically produced inflation, bank economists said. This monetary tightening reflected a switch from the pragmatic line pursued by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl since early this year to stabilise the mark externally, to the more cautious approach of Vice President Helmut Schlesinger. In an apparent gesture to Baker, coinciding with his visit, the Bundesbank repeatedly added money market liquidity this morning. Dealers said this was clearly a move to appease U.S. anger over the most recent West German interest rate rises. ""They (the Bundesbank) just don't want to come too much under American fire,"" said Chris Zwermann, currency adviser at Swiss Bank Corp here. ""It seems to me that this is the Bundesbank beating quite a significant retreat from its position,"" added Giles Keating, economist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London. The significance that retreat will emerge from the terms of the Bundesbank's next tender for a securities repurchase pact on Tuesday, and its result on Wednesday, money market economists said. Today's injection of liquidity shows that the Bundesbank does not want a further strong rise in the tender allocation rate, which is likely to turn out at between 3.80 and 3.90 pct, little changed from the 3.85 pct on the last facility. The Bundesbank and Finance Ministry had given no indication that the meeting would take place, although the Finance Ministry spokesman said it had been arranged last week. Earlier on Monday the Finance Ministry spokesman, asked to comment on the apparent U.S.-German clash over the Louvre accord, went no further than quoting Stoltenberg as saying he assumed monetary cooperation would continue. The spokesman said he believed Baker had already left West Germany for Sweden on Monday. This week he is also due to visit Denmark and Belgium."
"u.s., at u.n., claims self-defense for gulf attack",crude ship,"The United States invoked the right of self-defense in destroying an Iranian oil platform in the Gulf, the American delegation told the United Nations. Lieutenant General Vernon Walters sent letters about the incident to Security Council President Maurizio Bucci, the delegate of Italy, and Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar. U.N. press secretary Francois Giuliani said the Secretary General had no comment on the attack, which followed his appeal last Friday for restraint in the crisis while he pursued efforts to obtain a ceasefire between Iran and Iraq. In his explanation, Walters said the United States took defensive action in response to an Iranian attack against American ships in the Gulf. He cited an Iranian Silkworm missile strike last Friday in Kuwait waters against the United States-flag ship Sea Isle City. Walters said that military forces on the destroyed Iranian platform had engaged in a variety of actions against United States-flag and other nonbelligerent vessels and planes. ""In accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations (Charter), I wish, on behalf of my government, to report that United States forces have exercised the inherent right of self-defense under internation law by taking defensive action in response to attacks by . . . Iran against United States vessels in the Gulf,"" Walters said. Members of the Security Council met behind closed doors on Monday to discuss developments in the Gulf war, but no statement was issued afterwards."
france says u.s. had right to strike,crude ship,"France voiced its comprehension for a U.S. Attack on an Iranian target while calling for a swift halt to the Gulf War to avoid further escalation. ""The French authorities reaffirm their attachment to the freedom and security of navigation and to the right of all states to take action under international law and the United Nations charter to halt attacks such as that of October 16,"" the Foreign Ministry spokesman said in a statement. The United States said its forces destroyed an Iranian oil platform in the Gulf and struck at a second on Monday in retaliation for a recent Iranian missile attack on a U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti ship. Washington said the platforms were used to monitor shipping and to launch small-boat attacks on shipping. The French statement described the target as ""an Iranian military platform."" But the French statement added that ""everything must be done now to avoid that these military developments lead to a new escalation of the conflict."""
u.s. lawmakers support gulf action,ship crude,"American lawmakers rallied behind President Reagan for the U.S. strike against Iranian targets in the Gulf but the attack fueled a sharp new White House-Congress debate over limits on his powers to make war. The Pentagon announced on Monday that U.S. warships destroyed a non-producing oil platform used for monitoring Gulf ship traffic and military operations, and also raided a second Iranian oil rig in retaliation for an earlier Iranian attack on a Kuwaiti ship flying the American flag. Many Democrats, who control Congress, and Republicans expressed support for the attack and praised it as an appropriate ""measured response."" But Democrats and liberal Republicans voiced new fears that the growing confrontation between Tehran and the United States could erupt into a major war, and demanded that Reagan comply with the 1973 War Powers Act, which could lead to a pullout of American forces from the waterway. ""Those who contend the strike was necessary must realize their words are easily construed as a tacit endorsement of war with Iran,"" said Sen Mark Hatfield of Oregon, a Republican."
us tropical oil labeling plan suffers defeat,oilseed soybean veg-oil palm-oil palmkernel coconut-oil,"A proposal to require imported tropical oils to be labeled as saturated fats suffered a narrow and possibly debilitating defeat in the U.S. Senate. The Senate Agriculture Committee rejected the proposal by a 10-8 vote, virtually snuffing out U.S. soybean producers' hopes the plan would be adopted this year. A similar proposal has made no headway in the House. Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) offered the proposal as an amendment to a farm spending reduction package. ""I don't see this as a trade issue. I see it as giving American consumers the information they need,"" he said. Proponents of the measure, including the American Soybean Association, have claimed palm, palm kernel and coconut oils are high in saturated fat and can contribute to heart disease. The U.S. soybean industry believes labels indicating tropical oils are high in saturated fats would discourage consumption of the oils, imported primarily from Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. But Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) read a letter from U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, who said the proposal ""blatantly discriminates"" against imports, would be impossible to defend under international trade law and would harm relations with the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia. Yeutter's letter also said Americans derive most of their saturated fats from meat and dairy products and relatively little from tropical oils. The committee voted largely along party lines, with three Democrats joining seven Republicans to oppose the measure."
"u.s. forces destroyed oil rig, raided another",crude ship,"U.S. warships destroyed an Iranian oil platform in the Gulf on Monday and the Navy also raided a second oil rig in retaliation for Friday's Iranian missile attack on a U.S. flag tanker, the Pentagon said. President Reagan and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger warned Iran of even stronger countermeasures if the military escalation between the two countries continued in the volatile waterway. Reagan said he ordered the strike on the first platform by four U.S. destroyers, which fired about 1,000 five-inch shells at the Rostam oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain in the central Gulf. A short time later, Navy personnel boarded a second Iranian oil platform about five miles to the north and destroyed radar and communications equipment before leaving the structure, the Pentagon said. Defense Department spokesman Fred Hoffman told reporters that the second platform had been abandoned by Iranian personnel during the shelling and destruction of the first rig. The United States said both platforms were being used to keep track of Gulf merchant shipping and to launch speedboat attacks on such shipping by Iranian Revolutionary guards."
britain backs u.s. strike on iran oil platform,crude ship,"British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe backed the United States' attack on an Iranian oil platform on Monday and said it should not worsen the Gulf crisis. ""The United States is fully entitled to take military action in exercise of rights of self-defense, in the face of the imminent threat of further attacks,"" Howe said in a statement issued in London. The United States said its forces destroyed the platform on Monday in retaliation for an Iranian missile attack on a U.S.- flagged Kuwaiti ship last Friday. Referring to that attack, Howe added, ""I trust the Iranians will fully understand that continued attacks of this kind will only enhance justification for firm action in self-defense."" At a press conferenced in Luxembourg during a meeting of European Community (EC) ministers, Howe was asked about statements from a senior Iranian official who said America was now involved in a full-scale war. ""It would be profoundly undesirable and quite unjustified for Iran to react in that way,"" he said."
huge oil platforms dot gulf like beacons,crude ship,"Huge oil platforms dot the Gulf like beacons -- usually lit up like Christmas trees at night. One of them, sitting astride the Rostam offshore oilfield, was all but blown out of the water by U.S. Warships on Monday. The Iranian platform, an unsightly mass of steel and concrete, was a three-tier structure rising 200 feet (60 metres) above the warm waters of the Gulf until four U.S. Destroyers pumped some 1,000 shells into it. The U.S. Defense Department said just 10 pct of one section of the structure remained. U.S. helicopters destroyed three Iranian gunboats after an American helicopter came under fire earlier this month and U.S. forces attacked, seized, and sank an Iranian ship they said had been caught laying mines. But Iran was not deterred, according to U.S. defense officials, who said Iranian forces used Chinese-made Silkworm missiles to hit a U.S.-owned Liberian-flagged ship on Thursday and the Sea Isle City on Friday. Both ships were hit in the territorial waters of Kuwait, a key backer of Iraq in its war with Iran. Henry Schuler, a former U.S. diplomat in the Middle East now with CSIS said Washington had agreed to escort Kuwaiti tankers in order to deter Iranian attacks on shipping. But he said the deterrence policy had failed and the level of violence and threats to shipping had increased as a result of U.S. intervention and Iran's response. The attack on the oil platform was the latest example of a U.S. ""tit-for-tat"" policy that gave Iran the initiative, said Harlan Ullman, an ex-career naval officer now with CSIS. He said with this appraoch America would suffer ""the death of one thousand cuts."" But for the United States to grab the initiative militarily, it must take warlike steps such as mining Iran's harbors or blockading the mouth of the Gulf through which its shipping must pass, Schuler said. He was among those advocating mining as a means of bringing Iran to the neogtiating table. If vital supplies were cut off, Tehran could not continue the war with Iraq. Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomatic initiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose an arms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate. He said the United States should also threaten to mine and blockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq to acknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of a settlement. Iranian and Western diplomats say Iraq started the war by invading Iran's territory in 1980. Iraq blames Iran for the outbreak of hostilities, which have entailed World War I-style infantry attacks resulting in horrific casualties. Each side has attacked the others' shipping."
diplomats call u.s. attack on oil rig restrained,crude ship,"A U.S. attack on an Iranian oil platform in the Gulf on Monday appeared to be a tit-for-tat raid carefully orchestrated not to be too provocative or upset Arab allies, Western diplomats in the region said. U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said Monday that U.S. Warships destroyed the oil platform in the southern Gulf in response to a missile strike on the American-registered Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday. ""We consider the matter closed,"" he said, a signal the U.S. administration did not want the Gulf crisis to escalate. Iran had warned the United States earlier in the day against exacerbating the Gulf crisis, saying military action would endanger American interests. Following the raid, a okesman for Tehran's War Information Headquarters vowed to avenge the attack with a ""crushing blow."" ""The United States has entered a swamp from which it can in no way get out safely,"" Tehran Radio quoted him as saying. Diplomats noted, however, Iran was also seeking to avoid ostracism by Arab states due to meet at a summit in Amman on November 8 and discuss the Iran-Iraq war. Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi is currently in Damascus, and diplomats said he would seek Syrian help in preventing a total Arab breach with Tehran. Further escalation of the war threatening the Gulf Arab states could work against Tehran at the Amman gathering, they said. ""The ball is in Iran's court now. It's up to Tehran to respond one way or the other,"" a diplomat said. President Ronald Reagan warned Iran of stronger American countermeasures if the military escalation continued. Western diplomats and military sources in the area said shelling the platform appeared to be the least provocative act the United States could have taken once it had decided to retaliate for the tanker attack, blamed by both the Americans and Kuwaitis on Iran. ""It's interesting that they chose something in international waters because it doesn't implicate any other nation,"" one diplomat said. ""This was better for U.S. Relations with the Gulf Arab states, particularly Kuwait."" Commented another diplomat: ""Kuwait must be happy that the U.S. Has done something, but relieved that Faw was not attacked on its doorstep."" One source said of the attack on the oil platform: ""They managed to warn off the crew and hit something that was the least nuisance to everybody."" A diplomat commented: ""They were very clever in the place they chose. It gets attention, but it hasn't devastated anything because it wasn't working in the first place."" A senior Arab banker in the area said after the news broke: ""This was a good, measured response without risking a flare-up ... It is a face-saving response (for the Americans)."""
latest attack seen pointing up dilemmas for us,crude ship,"Military experts say the United States faces a dilemma in the Gulf following U.S. destruction of an Iranian oil platform in retaliation for an attack on a U.S.-flagged tanker. The experts told Reuters Tehran holds the initiative and is likely to control the tempo and direction of the conflict as long as America simply reacts to Iranian attacks by launching limited retaliatory strikes. But if Washington seizes the initiative with bolder steps -- such as mining Iran's harbors, blockading its shipping, or destroying key bases -- it could find itself in a major war. ""Iran is in the driver's seat in an absolute sense as the cycle of attack and retaliation continues,"" said Fred Axelgard, a Gulf War expert with the private Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). ""It's like a Greek tragedy,"" said retired Adm. Eugene Carroll of Washington's private Center for Defense Information (CDI) think tank. Some Middle East experts say the only way out is for Washington to join forces with Moscow in pressing for an end to the war between Iran and Iraq. They say it is not feasible for America to withdraw its 30-ship force from the Gulf area, where the Navy began escorting U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in July. Withdrawal would give the appearance of being chased away by Iran, which President Reagan could never accept. U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told a Pentagon news conference the destroyers Kidd, Young, Leftwich and Hoel fired about 1,000 rounds of five-inch shells at Iran's Rostam oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain beginning at about 1400 Gulf time (0700 EDT) on Monday. Weinberger said the platform had been used as a military base by Iran and that the attack responded to an Iranian Silkworm missile strike on the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City on Friday. Iranians manning the platform were warned in advance and allowed to escape. ""We do not seek further confrontation with Iran, but we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran with stronger countermeasures,"" Weinberger said. ""We consider this matter closed,"" he said. Analysts ranging from the liberal CDI to conservatives agreed the U.S. reaction was measured, reasonable and did not escalate the conflict unduly. But they said the question was whether Iran would consider the matter closed. It had not taken this view after earlier clashes."
u.s. drafts sanctions in argentina soy case,oilseed soybean,"The U.S. is drafting options including possible trade retaliation against Argentina in a dispute over the differential between soybean and product taxes which Buenos Aires levies on exports. The drafting of retaliation options follows the failure of high-level talks earlier this month to resolve a case filed by the U.S. National Soybean Processors Association, U.S. officials said. The NSPA charged that Argentina's differential export taxes implicitly subsidize soyproduct exports in competition with the U.S. ""Our only option is some sort of retaliation to restrict (Argentine) access to our market,"" said one U.S. source. The U.S. shelved the NSPA case earlier this year after Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said Argentina agreed to end the differential. But when Argentina announced export taxes for the 1987/88 year in July, the differential was narrowed only one pct. Deputy trade representative Michael Smith met Agriculture minister Ernesto Figuerras and Economy minister Juan Sourroille on September 29 and the Argentine officials said they could not narrow the differential further for 1987/88. As a result of the impasse, the U.S. is considering restrictions on imports of items such as Argentine corned beef and finished leather, the U.S. sources said. A decision on reprisals is likely to be made by the Reagan administration soon, they said."
iran vows reprisal for u.s. attack on oil rig,crude ship,"Iran said several people were injured in Monday's U.S. Attack on an Iranian offshore oil site and vowed retaliation, Tehran radio reported. It quoted President Ali Khamenei as saying, ""We will definitely retaliate and will not leave this American move unanswered."" A broadcast monitored in Nicosia said several civilian personnel on the Rashadat oil platforms in the Gulf east of Qatar were injured when U.S. Warships bombarded them this afternoon. It described damage as ""severe."" Washington said four American frigates shelled and destroyed two Iranian platforms at the Rashadat (formerly Rostam) field at 1100 GMT on Monday in response to Friday's missile attack on a U.S.-flag ship in Kuwaiti waters. The U.S. Said Iranians used the platforms for military pruposes and had fired on an American helicopter from the rigs earlier this month. Khamenei denied that the platforms had military gear or personnel and said the U.S. Attack lacked miltary value. ""With this move Mr. Reagan has committed a big mistake and has definitely increased his problems..."

The panel also approved measures that could trigger larger corn and wheat acreage reduction requirements, increase farmer-held reserve storage payments, reduce a potential milk support price cut, and require advance deficiency payments for producers of major crops. A proposal to require imported tropical oils be labeled on U.S. food products failed by a 10-8 vote."
fed's johnson warns against lower dollar,money-fx dlr,"Federal Reserve Board Vice-Chairman Manuel Johnson cautioned against seeking ""quick-fix solutions"" to persistent U.S. trade and federal budget deficits. In particular, he told an American Stock Exchange conference, a decline in the dollar below current levels would exacerbate financial market conditions. ""Trying to artificially depress the dollar severely below current levels ... would exacerbate financial market conditions and lead to further potential for financial problems."" Nowhere, Johnson said, are Fed officials hearing that U.S. businesses cannot compete at current exchange rates. He acknowledged the U.S. trade deficit was persisting despite a decline in the dollar's value of 40 to 50 pct in the past two years. But the deficit is improving in volume terms and will soon begin showing improvement. ""The stage I think is being set for a healthy, constructive expansion without inflationary instability,"" he said."
iran says us attack involves it in full-scale war,ship crude,"A top Iranian military official said America's attack on an Iranian oil platform on Monday had involved the United States in full-scale war and Iran would avenge it with a ""crushing blow."" ""The United States has entered a swamp from which it can in no way get out safely,"" the Iranian news agency IRNA quoted the head of Iran's war information headquarters as saying. The official, Kamal Kharrazi, said Washington had now become involved in what he called a full-fledged war with Iran. It was the first official Iranian reaction to the attack by four U.S. Navy destroyers on the Reshadat oil platform."
"senate panel studies loan rate, set aside plans",grain wheat corn,"The Senate Agriculture Committee was expected to consider proposals that would limit adjustments in county loan rate differentials which trigger larger corn and wheat acreage reduction requirements, Senate staff said. A budget-saving proposal drafted by chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt) would limit adjustments in county loan rate differentials to no more than one pct per year from the national average loan rate, starting with 1988 crops. The plan also would allow the Agriculture Secretary to increase the unpaid acreage reduction requirement for corn by ""an appropriate amount to generate savings"" if projected corn stocks exceeded 6.0 billion bushels. Leahy's proposal would also allow a larger 1988 wheat set aside if projected stocks surpassed 1.9 billion bushels."

study says pork leaner than usda figures show,livestock carcass hog,"An Iowa State University study showed pork contains considerably less fat than indicated by long-established U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics, the National Pork Producers Council (NPPC) said. Six of the seven muscle cuts evaluated in the study averaged 4.3 pct fat or less, well below American Heart Association guidelines for recommended foods. Eighty pct of all the raw boneless rib chops evaluated in the study contained less than six pct fat, the NPPC said. Meanwhile, USDA Handbook 8-10 - long used as the established authority on nutrient composition, indicates a fat content for center loin pork of 7.3 pct, the NPPC said. Robin Kline, a dietitian and Director of Consumer Affairs for the NPPC said he was not surprised at the wide discrepancy between the study and the USDA handbook. ""Handbook 8-10 is based to a certain extent on information that has been accumulated over the past 30 years. The statistics in it about pork do not reflect the hog of today which is about 50 pct leaner than it was 20 or 30 years ago, thanks to genetic improvements and better feeding practices,"" Kline said. The study, funded by NPPC with producer checkoff money, evaluated pork carcasses from 47 Iowa producers in categories from 0.7 to 1.3 inches of backfat. Researchers measured the fat content of the seven muscles before cooking, and the fat, moisture and tenderness of cooked boneless rib chops."
soviets outline 1988 economic targets,ipi gnp grain,"The Soviet Union outlined its economic targets for 1988 on Monday, stressing the need to improve standards in the country's sluggish engineering industry. Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin told the Supreme Soviet industrial output should rise by 4.5 pct in 1988, up from a planned 4.4 pct in 1987. It rose 3.6 pct in Jan-Sept 1987. Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalent to gross national product, should rise by 4.3 pct against a planned 4.1 pct this year. Gross national product measures the output of a country's goods and services. He said the Kremlin planned to produce 235 mln tonnes of grain in 1988 versus a planned 232 mln this year. Moscow produced 210 mln tonnes in 1986. Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has described machine-builing as a sector whose rapid modernization is essential if the Soviet Union is to compete effectively on world markets. ""Certain difficulties have arisen this year in the machine-building industry. The economy is not receiving a considerable amount of the equipment that it requires,"" said Talyzin, who heads the state planning committee GOSPLAN. Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makes machine tools, instruments and other engineering goods, increased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of 1987 compared with the same period last year. However, this was far below the 7.3 pct increase planned for the industry for the whole of 1988. Talyzin said the ruling Politburo had concluded at a recent meeting that an improvement in economic performance depended to a large extent on conserving resources better. ""Large-scale measures are planned to save resources,"" he said. Finance Minister Boris Gostev told the Supreme Soviet that defense spending in 1988 would total 32 billion dlrs, the same figure as was announced last year. Western governments view official Soviet estimates for defense spending as highly understated, but say the real figure is hard to calculate because Soviet military industries are intertwined with the civilian economy. Talyzin said the Kremlin also decided to increase spending next year on medical services, education, pensions and social insurance schemes."
turkey current account deficit widens in july,bop trade,"Turkey's current account deficit widened in July to 674 mln dlrs from 454 mln in June but fell from 1.22 billion in July last year, the State Statistics Institute said. The cumulative trade position in July showed a 1.85 billion dlr deficit after 1.33 billion in June and 1.89 billion a year earlier, with exports at 4.91 billion and imports, both FOB, at 6.76 billion. The government aims to narrow the current account deficit for the whole of 1987 to 975 mln dlrs, compared with 1.52 billion last year, up from 1.01 billion in 1985. Bankers forecast the 1987 deficit will exceed one billion dlrs, because a spurt in exports is expected to slow considerably in the last five months following a massive drawdown of inventories."

swiss analysts say mood on markets precarious,money-fx interest,"Today's sharp sell-off of Swiss stocks and matching falls around Europe may have been overdone, but the mood on financial markets is precarious, Swiss securities analysts and economists said. Panic selling took Swiss shares down six pct at the opening on enormous volume, triggered by the slide on Wall Street and the threat of renewed currency instability. ""I have never experienced anything like this, and I've been in the business for 20 years,"" said Bernhard Wyttenbach, head of European research at Union Bank of Switzerland. The analysts blamed the sell-off in Europe on U.S. Monetary authorities. This weekend, U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker publicly voiced his displeasure with West German monetary policy. He said the eight-month-old Louvre accord to stabilise currencies was still working, but added: ""On the other hand, we will not sit back and watch surplus countries jack up interest rates and squeeze growth on the expectation that the United States will raise rates."" Hans Peter Ast of Societe Generale Alsacienne (Sogenal) in Zurich said: ""The situation is very dangerous. Statements by the U.S. Authorities have fuelled anxiety about interest rates."" Herbert Fritschi, director of Zurich Cantonal Bank's financial research department, called the sell-off ""overdone,"" but warned that the situation could worsen unless central banks loosen their monetary policy. ""I think the trend toward higher interest rates is over,"" he said. ""The Federal Reserve and the Bundesbank have to step in with an easy money policy, or else there is going to be an economic catastrophe. They have to act quickly."" Wyttenbach said the ""Black Monday"" sell-off was clearly exaggerated, with Swiss Reinsurance Co participation certificates falling 20 pct in value at one point. But Wyttenbach said he did not believe that a correction would come soon. First, the bad news will reach small investors only in time for tomorrow's market, when there could be another, smaller selling wave. ""As soon as the dollar stabilises -- and that's the key -- then we'll get a strong movement upward,"" Wyttenbach said. But that may not come soon. ""People are simply worried that in America, where the market has now fallen by 18 pct since August, the bull market is over,"" he said. ""People are afraid that we'll have a recession in 1988."" Baker was wrong to blame the West Germans for the current problems and the weak dollar, Wyttenbach said. ""We do not have a mark problem, we have a dollar problem,"" he added, but said the biggest culprit was the new chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan. Wyttenbach recalled that Greenspan had suggested that the dollar might be too high in the medium term and that interest rates might have to rise. ""As a central banker he shouldn't do that,"" Wyttenbach said. ""There is a danger that we will fall back into the 1970s,"" he said. ""We have a real crisis of confidence in Greenspan. I would much rather have a Volcker."" Paul Volcker retired as Fed chairman on August 11. Cantonal Bank's Fritschi said: ""I'm relatively optimistic because the situation looks too bad. The Fed certainly has to intervene."" He said he did not expect the Swiss National Bank to take any significant steps, adding that the focus of attention remains on the United States. ""The panic started in New York, it has to end there."" The Cantonal Bank sent an advisory to customers suggesting they not sell into a panicked market, but wait a while before deciding what to do."
iran says u.s. naval forces attacked two platforms,ship crude,"Iran said U.S. Naval forces attacked two of its oil platforms in the southern Gulf on Monday afternoon, the Iranian news agency IRNA reported. IRNA, received in Nicosia, said an informed source at the Iranian oil ministry identified the two platforms as Resalat and Reshadat, about 60 miles from Iran's Lavan island oil storage site. Regional shipping sources earlier said three Iranian offshore oil sites at Sassan, Rostam and Rakhsh had been attacked at 7.00 A.M. (0300 GMT) on Monday by unidentified aircraft. In Washington, U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said four U.S. Destroyers attacked and destroyed an Iranian oil platform about 120 miles east of Bahrain."
u.s. naval forces attack iranian oil platform,ship crude,"U.S. warships attacked and destroyed an Iranian oil platform on Monday in retaliation for Friday's Iranian attack damaging a U.S.-flagged ship, U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said. When asked how much was left of the oil platform, Weinberger said, ""Nothing."" ""There was no Iranian reaction,"" he said. ""... We consider this matter is now closed."" Weinberger said four U.S. destroyers attacked the platform about 120 miles east of Bahrain in the central Gulf with fire at 0700 EDT, Weinberger said. ""We chose a platform used by the Iranians to interfere with and be a source of potential attack on convoys...,"" Weinberger said at a Pentagon briefing. ""We know it has been used indeed, to not only launch small boat attacks on shipping but to fire on U.S. helicopters... ""It's removal will contribute significantly to the safety of U.S. forces in the future,"" Weinberger said of the U.S. Navy's operation to escort oil tankers through the Gulf. ""We do not seek further confrontation with Iran but we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military actions by Iran with stronger countermeasures,"" Weinberger said. He said the 20 to 30 Iranian personnel on the oil platform were given a 20-minute warning to abandon the platform. ""As far as we know they did abandon the site,"" he said. Weinberger was asked why the United States had chosen to attack an oil platform rather than Iranian Silkworm missile platforms blamed by Washington for Friday's attack."
aircraft attack iranian oil rigs in southern gulf,ship crude,"Unidentified jets attacked three Iranian oil rigs in the southern Gulf early on Monday, setting at least one of them ablaze, regional shipping sources said. Earlier today in Washington, U.S. Television networks had reported that American forces launched a retaliatory strike against Iran late Sunday, attacking two Iranian offshore oil drilling platforms and setting them ablaze. The shipping sources said Iran's Sassan, Rostam and Rakhsh offshore oilfields were attacked at 0700 local (0300 GMT) by a wave of jet fighter bombers. Smoke was seen spiralling up from the Rostam field soon after. At least one of the other two targets was also believed to be ablaze, the sources said. The Sassan and Rostam fields have been targets for Iraqi air strikes in the past, but Baghdad had not reported any southern Gulf missions prior to news of the latest attack. Shipping and military sources in the region have said Iran used its southern Gulf rigs as bases to launch helicopter and later speedboat attacks on neutral ships in the waterway. U.S. Officials had been meeting on a response since Friday when an attack on a Kuwaiti port severely damaged a U.S.-flagged ship. President Reagan said on Sunday he had already made a decision on the U.S. Response to Friday's Iran attack but would not say what the decision was."

saudi to remain as key lpg supplier to japan,propane ship,"Saudi Arabia is likely to remain the key supplier of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to Japan for at least the next five years, oil industry sources said. Japan, while diversifying its supply sources of propane and butane for stable supplies, will continue to bank on Saudi Arabian LPG, the sources said. They said Saudi's supply capabilities of LPG, an associate of crude oil, is guaranteed by its crude output capacity. ""Saudi is a reliable supplier in that sense,"" said one trader. Japan imports about 50 pct of its LPG from Saudi Arabia. No single nation could substitute for Saudi Arabia as an LPG supply source to Japan, the sources said. ""Saudi Arabia has committed itself to Japanese LPG buyers, which has quelled fears that LPG supplies from the Mideast Gulf could easily be disrupted in the wake of heightened hostilities in that area,"" said another trader. Saudi Arabia cut LPG shipments to Japan and elsewhere by 20 pct in September after a fire put a major gas plant at Al-Juaimah out of operation. October shipments were back to contractual volumes as Saudi was able to boost exports from other ports. Attacks on Gulf shipping by Iran and Iraq centered on crude rather than products carriers, which has lulled fears of LPG supply disruptions, traders said. They said an Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz was unlikely because it would block Iran's oil shipments. Industry sources said Japan's LPG imports will not greatly rise or fall as its domestic demand growth is estimated at a moderate 2.1 pct a year from 1986 through 1991. Japanese term buyers of Saudi LPG are expected to lift slightly lower volumes from January 1987, when imports from Indonesia are slated to increase, the sources said. The customers are unlikely to slash Saudi term purchases in large scale when Japan increases annual imports of Indonesian LPG to 1.95 mln tonnes in early 1989 from 319,000 tonnes in the year ended March 1987, the sources said. But when demand is sluggish in summer, they will phase down term purchases of Saudi LPG and secure lower-priced cargoes on the spot market, they said. Japan imports some 12 mln tonnes of LPG a year, of which 5.3 mln tonnes are supplied by Saudi Arabia, 3.3 mln under term contracts and two mln through spot purchases. Some 80 pct of Japan's LPG imports are from the Middle East. Saudi Arabia's state owned oil company Petromin has made some concessions on term prices to Japanese customers in the recent round of contract renewal talks, and it is likely the Japanese will accept the offer, the sources said. The Japanese term customers, however, have so far been unsuccessful in establishing a transparent price formula to replace the existing unilateral monthly price notice. Japanese buyers pay Saudi Arabia a price notified by Petromin each month. Most recently the FOB price was set at 87 pct of the 17.52 dlrs per barrel government selling price (GSP) of Arabian Light. Buyers reserve the right to phase down or out liftings should the monthly price be set at over 95 pct of Arabian Light's GSP. Petromin has offered to lower this rate to 90 pct from the 95 pct for contracts with Japanese customers from next January, the trade sources said. Petromin also suggested that a seller's option of supplying up to 20 pct more than the contractural volume be subject to seller-buyer agreement. Under the present contract, Petromin can automatically cut supplies up to 10 pct of the contractual volume. ""If you want to import LPG from Saudi Arabia on a profitable basis, you have to set the price factor at 80 to 85 pct,"" said an official at a major importer. ""Freight costs are higher for cargoes coming from the Gulf than Southeast Asia due to a longer haul and war risk insurance payments."" Japanese customers will visit Saudi Arabia this month to finalise their separate contract talks, now focusing on contractual period and volume, which could be very similar to current levels, the sources said. ""When we talk business, we would seek profitability and sometimes forget vulnerability of high dependence on a single supplier,"" said one."
nbc news says u.s. has retaliated against iran,crude ship,"U.S. television networks said on Monday that U.S. forces launched a retaliatory strike against Iran late Sunday, apparently attacking two Iranian offshore oil drilling platforms. NBC News said it understood six Iranians had been pulled from the sea. It said cautiously that U.S. forces attacked late Sunday and that two Iranian oil platforms east of Bahrain were ablaze as a result, but CBS News and other networks said flatly that U.S. forces attacked the Iranian oil platforms. U.S. officials had been meeting on a response since Friday when an attack on a Kuwaiti port severely damaged a U.S.-flagged ship. President Reagan said on Sunday he had already made a decision on the U.S. response to Friday's Iran attack but would not say what the decision was. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Saturday the attack on a U.S.-flagged ship in Kuwaiti waters on Friday was almost certainly by an Iran Silkworm missile."

Traders and Internal Trade Department officials agreed last week to commission a study on a structure to regulate maize forward trading and to set up a company, Thailand Commodity Exchange Co Ltd, with 30 businesses as shareholders who will act as brokers in the futures market. Chanthong Pattamapong, a commodities trader asked to to draw up the study, said if the maize futures market succeeds it may be extended to other commodities, perhaps sugar and rubber."
indian reserve bank tightens credit policy,oilseed veg-oil,"The Reserve Bank of India said it was tightening its credit policy for commercial banks by raising their cash reserve ratio by 0.5 pct to 10 pct, effective from October 24. The move, announced last weekend, is part of the bank's policy for the second half of fiscal 1987/88 ending March and is aimed at curbing excess bank liquidity. The central bank also put selective controls on bank advances to the oilseeds, vegetable oils and foodgrains trades. ""The policy's main objective is to fully meet the credit requirements of agriculture, industry and exports, while preventing excessive monetary expansion,"" bank Governor R.N. Malhotra told an earlier meeting of chief executives of banks. Malhotra said the rate of monetary expansion must be kept under control in the second half of the current financial year. Bank deposits rose 75.40 billion rupees in the first six months of fiscal 1987/88 against 66.92 billion in the same period last year, according to the bank. Bankers said the bank's move to raise the cash reserve ratio by 0.5 pct will mean impounding about five billion rupees from the banking system. Banks' total deposits are estimated at around 1,000 billion rupees. They said banks are under pressure because of low returns on commercial lending and investments in government securities. ""Already many banks are finding it difficult to maintain their statutory liquidity and cash reserve ratios and are resorting to heavy inter-bank borrowings,"" said one banker."
kuwaiti oil exports said not affected by gulf war,crude ship,"Kuwait's oil exports have not been affected by the seven-year Iran-Iraq war, Kuwait Oil Tanker Company (KOTC) Chairman and Managing Director Abdul Fattah al-Bader told a Kuwaiti newspaper. ""Kuwait has exploited all available opportunities to continue exporting its oil without any reduction,"" the Al-Anbaa newspaper quoted him as saying. He said KOTC made profits of more than two mln dinars (seven mln dlrs) in the fiscal year ending last June, but predicted lower profits this year due to higher costs for chartering and operating vessels."
german financial policy makers in rare dissension,money-fx interest,"Karl Otto Poehl, head of West Germany's central bank, and Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg are normally so much in agreement that some foreigners doubt the central bank's independence. But a rare public row between the ebullient Poehl, president of the Bundesbank, and Stoltenberg, over a controversial investment tax proposal, has added to the woes of the country's already nervous financial markets, bankers said. Poehl told an investment symposium in Frankfurt last Thursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs and interest rates Stoltenberg quickly issued a statement rebutting Poehl's criticism, saying West Germany would remain an attractive place for foreign investors. ""The obvious lack of coordination between the Bundesbank and Finance Ministry does not instil confidence in foreign investors,"" said one economist for a London broker, who asked not to be identified. Bankers here expressed confidence the two top financial policy-makers would quickly patch up their relationship to steer the economy through a particularly difficult time. ""There are plenty of objective pressures which will result in things getting back to normal again after a period of ill feeling,"" said Commerzbank AG chief economist Juergen Pfister. News on October 9 that the government was planning a 10 pct withholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds in a market already reeling from rising interest rates at home and abroad. Bankers said the Bundesbank was angered by the way the finance ministry announced the plan -- without consulting the Bundesbank adequately, and allowing apparently conflicting details to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market. Both Poehl, 57, and Stoltenberg, 59, have been under extraordinary pressures lately. Poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by his deputy, Helmut Schlesinger, jacking up interest rates to fight inflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he had pursued so far this year to promote currency stability. In recent statements Poehl has sounded more like Schlesinger. For years the softly-spoken economist has been warning in speech after speech that excessive money supply growth would eventually lead to rising prices. Schlesinger now has a majority of support in the Bundesbank council, and since late summer Poehl has had to represent his views, bankers said. ""Poehl is in a minority in his own house,"" said Commerzbank's Pfister. ""Poehl is in a dilemma. He must follow a policy that is not entirely his own,"" said another economist. The dilemma is that if German interest rates rise too far, they will attract funds into the country, pushing up the mark and hurting West German exporters. The dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the Bundesbank's new tack became clear in early October. Since last Thursday, United States Treasury Secretary James Baker has criticized the Bundesbank rate increases. Bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986 war of words between the U.S. And West Germany, in which U.S. Officials talked down the dollar to force West Germany to stimulate its economy and thus suck in more U.S. Exports. One way West Germany agreed to do this was making a round of tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990. But financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for Stoltenberg than he had bargained for. The cool, unflappable northerner, who was regularly voted most popular government politician last year, had to face resistance from local barons in the government coalition parties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts. The withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising 4.3 billion marks. But it has caused an outcry among bankers, who say it will push up borrowing costs. The extra amount this costs the government could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in. Meanwhile Stoltenberg is dealing with a local political row which has turned into the country's worst political scandal. Stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in Washington last month early to sort out a row in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein, where he heads the ruling CDU party. The state's CDU premier, Uwe Barschel, had to resign after allegations of a ""dirty tricks"" election campaign led to heavy losses for the CDU in state elections. Barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in Geneva last weekend. Police say the death appears to have been suicide. Cooperation between Poehl and Stoltenberg is all the more remarkable as Poehl is in the opposition Social Democrats, and was appointed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt. When Poehl's contract came up for renewal earlier this year, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-led coalition government gave Poehl another eight-year term. Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said he hoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again. But when Poehl criticized Stoltenberg's tax plans he was not only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the Bundesbank's independence of government, Chrobok said."
papers say venezuelan central bank chief to resign,money-fx interest,"Venezuelan Central Bank President Hernan Anzola has submitted his resignation and asked President Jaime Lusinchi to transfer him to a post in the oil industry, two leading Venezuelan newspapers reported. The El Universal and El Nacional papers said Anzola would leave his position soon. Lusinchi already has decided on his successor, the El Nacional reported. Central Bank officials were not available for comment. Banking sources said Anzola differed with the Finance Ministry over economic policy, particularly over the direction of interest rates. He favoured raising the rates, which are currently well below the annual inflation rate of 33.2 pct. But the sources said he ran into opposition from Finance Ministry and government officials who thought an interest increase would fuel inflation."
higher spending expected in malaysia's 1988 budget,gnp jobs bop,"Malaysia's recovery from the worst recession in 20 years should receive a boost on Friday when the government announces a reflationary budget for calendar 1988 after seven years of austerity, economists said. ""Our country is walking on one leg now,"" said Ismail Salleh, an economist with the Institute of Strategic and International Studies. ""It has to depend on public sector investment for faster growth if the private sector is not moving."" Gross domestic product grew one pct in 1986 after shrinking one pct in 1985. The fiscal year ends December 31. The government has said it expects 1987 growth to be under two pct but some analysts believe it will be nearer three pct because prices for commodity exports have risen sharply. Malaysia is a leading exporter of rubber, palm oil, tin and semiconductors and a major producer of cocoa, timber and oil. The government slashed development spending to 9.8 billion ringgit this year from 14.5 billion in 1986. Economists said unemployment is expected to exceed 10 pct in 1988 against about 9.5 pct this year. Local investment also has stagnated, with businessmen blaming inconsistent economic policies and lack of incentives. One businessman said too many politicians give the impression that Malaysia was unstable. ""If we can take care of investment confidence, the potential to recover strongly is great,"" a banker said. Malaysia's 1987 current account is expected to be in the black with the Central Bank projecting a 500 mln ringgit surplus compared with last year's 1.2 billion ringgit deficit. The government has said its fiscal policies will balance the budget by 1989. The deficit in 1986 was 952 mln ringgit. The government will also repay some of its external debt, which stood at 51 billion ringgit at the end of 1986. Political leaders have said the budget will not hurt ordinary people as taxes on basic food and other essential goods are unlikely to change. Businessmen said they hope the government also will cut the corporate tax, now between 45 and 48 pct, to enable Malaysia to compete for investors with neighbouring states."

china forecasts 397 mln tonnes grain harvest,grain cotton,"China expects its 1987 grain harvest to be 397 mln tonnes, eight mln tonnes short of its target, the New China News Agency quoted a State Statistical Bureau spokesman as saying. The harvest will be China's second highest in history but poor weather and low incentives for grain-producing farmers have kept yields down, earlier Chinese press reports said. Industry sources expect China to import at least 10 mln tonnes of grain this year because of the harvest shortfall. Chinese customs figures showed grain imports of 9.59 mln tonnes in the first eight months of 1987, compared with 6.09 mln in the same 1986 period. Agriculture Minister He Kang said last month state prices for grain purchase from growers were to be adjusted to increase the incentive for grain production. China could not afford to become a major food importer, he said. The State Statistics Bureau spokesman also said China's 1987 cotton output was expected to rise 10 pct over 1986 to 390 mln tonnes."
volkskas bank sees rand hinging on inflation rate,money-fx rand,"South Africa must drive down its inflation rate to much lower levels to prevent a further decline in the rand, said Volkskas Bank in its monthly economic review. The bank said that without a major drop in the inflation rate, the rand was bound to eventually decrease even more, regardless of a sharp rise in the gold price. Inflation is running at an annual rate of some 17 pct and the rand is around 49.53 U.S. Cents. Most economists estimate continued high inflation. Volkskas predicted the rand will remain fairly steady for the rest of 1987 and then ease slightly next year."
"louvre accord still in effect, japan official says",money-fx dlr yen dmk,"The Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations still comply with last February's Louvre accord to stabilize currencies, a senior Bank of Japan official said. And U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's remarks at the weekend indicating the need to revise it do not herald a lower range for the dollar, other senior officials from the Bank of Japan and Finance Ministry agreed in interviews. ""The exchange market is apparently reacting too much, and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret it later on,"" the Bank of Japan official told Reuters. The Bank official said Baker did not mean to talk the dollar down. A lower dollar would harm the U.S. Economy, he noted. A Finance Ministry official who was directly involved in monetary talks with other nations also said the U.S. Would never attempt to lower the reference range for the dollar against the mark or the yen. The market assumes the dollar reference range to be between 140-150 yen and between 1.70 and 1.90 marks. The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 1.7730/35 marks and 141.35 yen. ""Behind Baker's remark was U.S. Frustration over higher interest rates abroad, especially in West Germany, but this does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the Louvre accord,"" the Finance Ministry official said. He said that on the contrary Baker wanted to avoid any further rise in U.S. Interest rates because it would not only hurt the U.S. Economy but aggravate the Third World debt problem. Higher U.S. Interest rates would merely raise their interest payment burden and depress U.S. Stock and bond markets further, the monetary officials said. Both the ministry and central bank officials, who declined to be named, noted the U.S. No longer wants to see a further decline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationary expectations in the U.S. ""That's why Baker did not fail to add that the Louvre agreement is still operative,"" the senior ministry official said. Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday that Washington would reexamine the Louvre accord because of West Germany's increase in short-term interest rates. The market at first interpreted this as indicating the U.S. Would be ready to scrap the Louvre accord and let the dollar decline further unless surplus countries, notably West Germany, try harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in the accord, foreign exchange dealers said. But the market on reflection also noted Baker's additional statement that ""the Louvre agreement is still operative,"" and this caused some dollar short-covering in Tokyo today, the dealers said. Uncertainty, however, remained the flavour of the day in Tokyo currency markets. The Japanese monetary officials said Baker's undisguised pressure on West Germany to refrain from guiding interest rates higher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance, or international economic policy coordination. The G-7, comprising the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada, have agreed to monitor each other's economic policies and from time to time apply ""peer pressure"" to persuade others to change their policies to a desired course, they noted. ""Without such a basic agreement of multilateral surveillance, Baker would never have criticized the West German policy so openly,"" the ministry official said. The U.S.-West German squabble over Bonn's monetary policy should thus be regarded as a process of healthy policy coordination and not as any indication of a possible collapse of the Louvre agreement, the official said. He also said Japan has not received any specific request from the U.S. On its monetary policy, although its short-term money rates have been edging higher. ""This is because we, unlike the Germans, are not taking policy to guide interest rates higher, and the marginal rate rise in recent days is primarily for seasonal reasons,"" he added."
economist urges more taxes to lower n.z. dollar,money-fx nzdlr,"An income tax surcharge and capital gains tax could bring about an urgently needed depreciation of the N.Z. Dollar, independent economist Len Bayliss said. Bayliss, a former economist with the Reserve Bank and the Bank of New Zealand, said a major depreciation is needed to restore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut by current government policies. The taxes would help cut the budget deficit, which in turn would lower the value of the N.Z. Dollar, he said in a speech. He added that the deficit for the year ending March 1988 could be much higher than the government's 1.3 billion dlr forecast. Since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product, a major tax increase was probably unavoidable, Bayliss said. He would have preferred an increase in the 10 pct value-added goods and services tax, introduced in October 1986, but that would have had a short-term inflationary impact. Import tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationary impact of a currency depreciation. The government had failed to bring inflation down despite lower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency, he added. New Zealand's inflation rate was 16.9 pct in the year to end-September against 18.9 pct in the year to end June. The major deficiency in the government's anti-inflation policies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates and insufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit, Bayliss said. The government had also failed to reduce overseas debt and debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit. ""The widespread belief that (New Zealand's) problems are going to take much longer to solve than was originally thought is soundly based -- primarily because the government's macro-economic policies have been unsuccessful,"" Bayliss said."
thai rice exports rise in week to october 13,grain rice,"Thai rice exports rose to 72,987 tonnes in the week ended October 13 from 54,075 the previous week, the Commerce Ministry said.

tokyo dealers see dollar poised to breach 140 yen,money-fx dlr yen,"Tokyo's foreign exchange market is watching nervously to see if the U.S. Dollar will drop below the significant 140.00 yen level, dealers said. ""The 140 yen level is key for the dollar because it is considered to be the lower end of the reference range. If the currency breaks through this level, it may decline sharply,"" said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant general manager at Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd's international treasury division. The dollar was at 141.10 yen at midday against Friday closes of 142.35/45 in New York and 141.35 here. The dollar opened at 140.95 yen and fell to a low of 140.40. It was 1.7733/38 marks against 1.7975/85 in New York and 1.8008/13 here on Friday, after an opening 1.7700/10. The currency's decline was due to remarks on Sunday by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker, dealers said. ""The dollar fell over the weekend on increased bearish sentiment after Baker's comments,"" said Dai-ichi's Tanaka. He said this stemmed from mounting concern that cooperation among the group of seven (G-7) industrial nations to implement the Louvre accord to stabilise currencies might be fraying. The dollar's fall was also prompted by a record one-day drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday and weakness in U.S. Bond prices, dealers said. Baker said the Louvre accord was still operative but he strongly criticised West German moves to raise key interest rates. Operators took Baker's comment to indicate impatience with some G-7 members for failing to stick to the Louvre accord due to their fears of increasing inflation. Rises in interest rates aimed at dampening inflationary pressures also slow domestic demand. West Germany and Japan had both pledged at G-7 meetings to boost domestic demand to help narrow the huge U.S. Trade deficit, Tanaka said. U.S. August trade data showed the U.S. Deficit at a still massive 15.68 billion dlrs. But if West Germany raises interest rates, this would run counter to the pledge, he said. ""Operators are now waiting to see if the G-7 nations coordinate dollar buying intervention,"" said Soichi Hirabayashi, deputy general manager of Fuju Bank Ltd's foreign exchange department. The target range set by the Louvre accord is generally considered to be 140.00 to 160.00 yen, dealers said. ""The market is likely to try the 140 yen level in the near future and at that time, if operators see the G-7 nations failing to coordinate intervention, they would see the Louvre accord as abandoned and push the dollar down aggressively,"" Hirabayashi said. He said the U.S. Currency could fall as low as 135 yen soon."
